**Heading:** Clinical Outcomes of Patients with Chronic Neuropathic Form of Gaucher Disease in the Spanish Real-World Setting: A Retrospective Study

**Body:**

Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare disease caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) due to bi-allelic mutations in the GBA1 gene. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of glucocerebroside lipids in organs, resulting in various symptoms. The pathophysiological mechanisms of neurological involvement are not well explained. Substrate accumulation in neurons is low, with significant accumulation only when residual GCase activity is extremely low.

GD is the most common lysosomal storage disease and is classified into three types based on neurologic manifestations. Type 1 is the non-neuronopathic form, affecting the hematopoietic system, skeletal system, and visceral organs. Types 2 and 3 involve the central nervous system, with type 2 being acute and fatal within two years, and type 3 being subacute/chronic. GD3 is subdivided into three subtypes: GD3a (neurological involvement), GD3b (internal organ and skeletal involvement), and GD3c (cardiovascular type). The presence of the p.Asn409Ser allele excludes the diagnosis of types 2 or 3.

Comprehensive patient management protocols are needed to delineate the full phenotypic spectrum of GD3, identify the best clinical and treatment options, and provide optimal care. Different dosages of enzyme replacement and chaperone treatments have been tested, but a consensus on pharmacological treatment pathways is missing. An international registry of GD patients serves as a reference for patient characteristics, treatments, and outcomes. Delays in diagnosis, frequent hospitalization, and limited access to medical care are common issues for GD patients. Country-specific studies are required due to differences in patient management protocols.

This retrospective, multicenter study included all patients diagnosed with GD3 in Spain, followed up at 10 centers. Data were collected from medical records between May 2021 and May 2022. The study aimed to report the characteristics of GD3 patients in Spain, including genotype, phenotype, therapeutic options, and treatment responses. The primary objective was to describe the clinical outcome and treatment characteristics of GD3 patients.

Clinical and demographic variables included age, sex, pregnancy history, family history, age at disease onset, and diagnosis. Organ manifestations were assessed through clinical examination and additional tests. Bone involvement was determined by bone pain or abnormal radiological findings. Hepatic dysfunction was defined by elevated hepatic transaminase levels. Hematological disease included thrombocytopenia and anemia.

Neurological phenotype was determined by age at onset and neurological manifestations at diagnosis and during follow-up. Treatment variables included specific GD medications, neurologic symptomatic therapies, and procedures. Descriptive analyses were performed using SAS statistical software.

A total of 19 patients with GD3 were enrolled, with a mean age of 12.37 years. The median age at disease onset was 1 year, with a median age at diagnosis of 1.2 years. Most patients had a normal pregnancy history. Four patients had a family history of consanguinity, and three had other relatives affected by GD3. No significant perinatal history was observed, except in one patient.

Most patients exhibited splenomegaly and hepatomegaly at diagnosis. Hematological disease was detected in 9 patients with thrombocytopenia and 11 with anemia. Bone involvement was mild, with 5 patients presenting bone alteration detected by X-ray or MRI. Severe cardiac involvement was detected in two patients. Pulmonary disease was present in six patients at the end of the follow-up.

At diagnosis, GD3 patients presented physical features such as short stature and microcephaly. Neurological manifestations included abnormalities of horizontal ocular movement, psychomotor delay, pyramidal signs, extrapyramidal features, gait ataxia, and tremor. Epilepsy affected 4 patients at diagnosis and 6 during follow-up. Cranial nerve manifestations were significant and mainly detected at the end of the follow-up.

Two genetic variants (c.1448T>C and c.1342G>C) accounted for over 70% of the pathogenic alleles. All patients received enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) at diagnosis and during the study. The hematological alterations, hepatic dysfunction, and organomegaly responded well to ERT. However, neurological manifestations, kyphoscoliosis, and valvular calcifications continued to progress.

This study summarized the characteristics of GD3 patients in Spain, including demographic data, genotype and phenotype profiles, therapeutic interventions, and the evolution of disease-related organ and neurological manifestations. The clinical heterogeneity of GD3 poses challenges in recognizing the disease and distinguishing between different phenotypes. Diagnostic algorithms may improve early diagnosis and enable targeted treatments. Monitoring neurological signs and symptoms during childhood is imperative for all types of GD.

Visceral manifestations were mostly detected at diagnosis and controlled with ERT. However, other peripheral manifestations appeared during follow-up and had an unclear relationship with treatment. Bone involvement was mild, unlike the GD1 phenotype. Growth retardation and microcephaly were also observed. Long-term studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bone therapy in GD3 patients.

The most frequent neurological abnormalities were psychomotor retardation and extrinsic muscle disorders. Sensorineural deafness was frequent in this series. Neurological abnormalities may appear later in the disease course, after hematologic and visceral manifestations. The classic phenotype of GD3 is characterized by a combination of neurological and visceral symptoms.

Regarding mortality, three cases corresponded to patients with severe neurological disease. Two well-known variants associated with neurological symptoms in GD constituted more than 70% of the disease-causing alleles. ERT is currently the only approved specific treatment for the pediatric population. However, it does not cross the blood–brain barrier, precluding a direct impact on CNS manifestations.

Patients with GD3 show a wide degree of variation in neurological progression and severity of systemic disease, making the assessment of outcomes with available therapies difficult. Oral ambroxol at high doses had good safety and tolerability, significantly increased lymphocyte glucocerebrosidase activity, permeated the blood–brain barrier, and decreased glucosylsphingosine levels in cerebrospinal fluid.

This study has several limitations, including low prevalence and high genotypic and phenotypic disparity. Despite these limitations, the study included 19 GD3 patients from different regions of Spain. The study did not evaluate patient/caregiver burden and quality of life. Future research is anticipated to address this omission.

This registry of GD3 patients is the most detailed series in terms of clinical and neurological characteristics in Spain. The data may be compared to other GD3 registries, helping to increase the body of evidence on this rare disease and contributing to improving the clinical management of GD3 patients."
