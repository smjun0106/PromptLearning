#### Women with Gaucher Disease

**Gaucher Disease (GD):**
- GD is a rare hereditary disease caused by mutations in the GBA1 gene.
- This mutation results in a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase.
- The deficiency leads to the accumulation of glucosylceramide in macrophages of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow.

**Clinical Phenotypes:**
- **Type 1 GD:** Non-neuronopathic form with hematological abnormalities, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone involvement.
- **Type 2 GD:** Acute neuronopathic form with significant central nervous system involvement and high childhood mortality.
- **Type 3 GD:** Neurological involvement with a less severe course than Type 2 and a better prognosis.
- GD is associated with comorbidities like Parkinson's disease and hematology neoplasms, especially multiple myeloma.

**Treatment:**
- **Enzyme-Replacement Therapy (ERT):** Intravenous administration of active enzyme (Imiglucerase and Velaglucerase alfa).
- **Substrate-Reduction Therapy (SRT):** Inhibition of glucosylceramide synthetase (Eliglustat and Miglustat).
- These treatments have improved survival and quality of life.

**Symptomatology in Women:**
- **Growth Retardation:** Up to 50% incidence in untreated patients, likely multifactorial.
- **Puberty Delay:** Up to 60% incidence, more frequent in severe cases.
- **Menorrhagia:** A major problem, affecting 73% of patients, related to thrombocytopenia and altered platelet function.
- **Psychosocial Impact:** Chronic illness can lead to feelings of anger, denial, fear, insecurity, and isolation.

**Reproductive Planning:**
- **Contraceptives:** Oral contraceptives and surgical methods are common. Copper IUDs are not recommended for those with menorrhagia.
- **Pregnancy:** SRT must be interrupted 3 months before pregnancy and replaced by ERT. Genetic counseling is essential.
- **Genetic Risks:** Patients should be informed about the risk of transmitting GD and the increased risk of Parkinson's disease.

**Pregnancy and GD:**
- **Complications:** Potential complications include splenic rupture, bone fractures, and liver function dysregulation.
- **Monitoring:** Regular assessment of nutritional support, organomegalies, bone, and hematological manifestations.
- **Vitamins and Supplementation:** Iron, folic acid, vitamin B12, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation are recommended.
- **Delivery:** Vaginal delivery is preferred. Cesarean birth should avoid longitudinal central incisions if organomegaly is present.
- **Postpartum:** Management depends on pregnancy evolution and delivery characteristics. Close follow-up is recommended for risk factors.

**Bone Health:**
- **Osteoporosis:** Common in GD, especially post-menopausal women. Periodic densitometry and supplementation with vitamin D and calcium are recommended.
- **ERT and Bisphosphonates:** ERT improves osteopenia, and bisphosphonates increase bone density but may cause osteonecrosis.

**Cancer Risk:**
- **Malignancies:** Higher risk of liver, kidney, breast cancer, and melanoma. Standard screening protocols are recommended.

**Conclusion:**
- **Multidisciplinary Follow-Up:** Essential during pregnancy and lactation.
- **ERT Initiation:** Recommended for symptomatic patients during pregnancy.
- **SRT Discontinuation:** Advised due to limited evidence.
- **Early Menopause:** Accelerates osteopenia development, necessitating periodic densitometry."
