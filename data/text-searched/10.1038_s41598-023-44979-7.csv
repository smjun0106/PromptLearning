#### Abstract
Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by the brain deposition of insoluble amyloidogenic proteins, such as α-synuclein or Tau, and the concomitant deterioration of cell functions such as the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP). ALP dysfunction due to inherited defects in lysosomal or non-lysosomal proteins causes lysosomal storage disorders (LSD). Supporting the contribution of ALP defects in neurodegenerative diseases, deposition of amyloidogenic proteins occurs in LSD. Heterozygous mutations of several ALP genes represent risk factors for Parkinson's disease. The reciprocal contribution of α-synuclein accumulation and lysosomal dysfunction has been extensively studied. However, whether this adverse crosstalk also embraces Tau pathology needs more investigation. Here, we show in human primary fibroblasts that Tau seeds isolated from the brain of Alzheimer's disease induce Tau accumulation in acidic degradative organelles and lysosomal stress. Inhibition of glucocerebrosidase, a lysosomal enzyme mutated in Gaucher's disease and a main risk for Parkinson's disease, causes lysosomal dysfunction in primary fibroblasts and contributes to the accumulation of Tau. Considering the presence of Tau lesions in Parkinson's disease as well as in multiple neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, our data call for further studies on strategies to alleviate ALP dysfunction as new therapeutic opportunities for neurodegenerative diseases and LSD.

#### Introduction
A hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders is the deposition of insoluble protein aggregates composed of amyloidogenic proteins in the brain. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid plaques and neurofibrillar hyperphosphorylated Tau protein aggregates. Parkinson's disease (PD) presents α-synuclein deposition within Lewy bodies and neurites, and also Tau lesions. Protein deposits are linked to a decline of cell functions culminating in cell death. The autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) degrades intracellular macromolecules and organelles. ALP dysfunction is proposed to contribute to the neurodegenerative process. Increased deposition of amyloidogenic proteins in lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) supports this. LSD are caused by inherited defects in lysosomal or non-lysosomal proteins resulting in aberrant buildup of lysosomal substrates and deleterious ALP dysfunction.

#### Results
**Generation and characterization of human fibroblast lines expressing Tau fused to fluorescent proteins**
To examine the subcellular distribution of Tau in primary human dermal fibroblasts, we fused the cDNA of Tau2N4R with mCherry or Gamillus, two differently emitting fluorescent proteins resistant to acidic pH. A third construct was obtained by tagging Tau2N4R with both mCherry and GFP (tandem-Tau). The cDNAs were inserted into the pInducer20 vector for packaging into lentiviral pseudo particles. Upon transduction for inducible expression of the single Tau variants, cells were characterized for Tau expression by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Protein expression was induced by cell treatment with doxycycline for 2 days. Upon induction with 0.3 μg/mL doxycycline, all three fluorescent Tau variants were found in a pattern of cytosolic distribution consistent with the association of Tau to the microtubule network. Single cell analysis by flow cytometry showed a doxycycline dose-dependent increase in the amount of Tau present in the cell. Maximal induction levels were reached at about 0.3 μg/mL doxycycline. In the geneticin-resistant cell populations, the percentage of positive cells varied from 75% for tandem-Tau to 89% and 94% for Tau-mCherry and Tau-Gamillus, respectively. Only a few cells expressed Tau in the absence of doxycycline indicating that the inducible system was not leaky. In the following experiments, Tau expression was routinely induced in the presence of 0.3 μg/mL doxycycline for 2 days.

**Tau localizes in DOs upon autophagy stimulation**
Pharmacologic manipulation of the ALP system was performed to assess whether Tau may represent a substrate of autophagy and be targeted to degradative organelles (DOs) of human fibroblasts. Autophagy was stimulated by mTOR inhibition with KU-0063794. In contrast, autophagy flux and DO acidification were inhibited with the vacuolar proton pump blocker bafilomycin A1. Acidic DOs in Tau-Gamillus fibroblasts were labelled with the acidotrophic marker LysoTracker Red emitting red fluorescence. KU-0063794 treatment strongly increased the number of LysoTracker positive DOs. Under basal conditions, Tau-Gamillus had a diffuse cytosolic pattern. The presence of KU-0063794 led to the appearance of Tau-Gamillus puncta that appeared colocalized with LysoTracker-positive DOs. In contrast, bafilomycin A1 eliminated the signal for the acidotrophic LysoTracker Red signal and did not induce the formation of Tau-Gamillus puncta. Quantitative laser confocal microscopy analysis proved that KU-0063794 increased the number and size of LysoTracker-positive DOs, as well as the mean number of Tau-Gamillus puncta per cell. Consistent results were obtained when analyzing Tau-mCherry fibroblasts with LysoTracker Green DND-26. We concluded that Tau is a likely target of the autophagic pathway when ectopically expressed in primary human dermal fibroblasts. Although it is known that Tau is an autophagy substrate, our experimental conditions cannot exclude the contribution of the biofluorescent markers fused to Tau for this observation.

**AD-derived brain seeds induce Tau accumulation in DOs**
We reported that fibrillogenic fragments of Tau carried by extracellular vesicles induced an aberrant accumulation of intracellular Tau within DOs of mouse neuronal C17.2 cells. Next, we studied whether Tau accumulation may occur also in DOs of human primary fibroblasts incubated with fibrillogenic seeds. We isolated Tau seeds from postmortem human AD brain. The presence of Tau lesions in the AD brain tissue used for the fractionation was first verified by immune fluorescence staining with antibodies for total Tau. This evidenced robust Tau pathology in the form of neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads that were also positive for the triply phospho-epitope of Tau recognized by the AT8 antibody. An established differential centrifugation protocol was implemented to enrich Tau seeds starting from 2 g AD brain wet tissue. The initial P0 and S0 fractions accounted for ~ 120 mg and ~ 105 mg total protein, respectively, whereas the final S3 fraction contained ~ 1.7 mg total protein. The main fractions obtained were analyzed by western blot. The final supernatant S3 contained the largest relative amount of AT8-positive phosphorylated Tau when compared to the other fractions, although 10-time lower amounts of S3 protein were loaded on the gel, showing at least a 1000-fold enrichment of Tau seeds following this protocol.

Overnight addition of the Tau seeds to the culture medium of doxycycline-induced fibroblasts resulted in the robust accumulation of Tau-mCherry puncta in cells. Interestingly, also the number per cell of LysoTracker-positive DOs was increased. However, the effect of Tau seeds on DO number was not affected by the expression of Tau, indicating a lysosomal stress response caused by the treatment. In contrast, the increase of DO mean size required the presence of Tau, suggesting that intracellular Tau accumulation contributed to seed-induced lysosomal stress.

To further document Tau accumulation in DOs, we took advantage of the tandem-Tau system. Due to the instability of GFP in an acidic environment, we predicted that upon entry into acidic DOs, GFP emission would be lost but mCherry emission preserved, similarly to what described for the autophagy receptor LC3B. Under control conditions, and upon induction of tandem-Tau expression with doxycycline, cells displayed GFP (in green) and mCherry (in magenta) fluorescence along the microtubule network. Treatment of the cells with the autophagy stimulator KU-0063794 again led to tandem-Tau accumulation in puncta that, yet, lacked GFP emission. Determination of the mCherry/GFP emission ratio for tandem-Tau puncta or for whole cells by quantitative laser confocal microscopy confirmed this property of tandem-Tau. Based on this observation, and to obtain more quantitative data, we next evaluated the use of cytofluorimetry as a mean to quantify the localization of Tau in acidic DOs. In the presence of KU-0063794, we observed a small, but statistically significant shift of the ratio of mean mCherry fluorescence over mean green fluorescence by cytofluorimetry. The relatively small effect determined with this assay was possibly explained by double-fluorescent Tau present in the cytoplasm, which was partially masking the shift to mCherry fluorescence when Tau reached acidic DOs.

Prompted by the data obtained, we assessed the effect of Tau seeds when supplemented to tandem-Tau cells. We found that also in this case Tau seed-induced tandem-Tau puncta displayed increased mCherry/GFP emission ratio when analyzed by confocal microscopy or by cytofluorimetry. These data indicated that Tau accumulation in fibroblasts occurred mainly in acidic DOs when induced by autophagy stimulation of treatment with extracellular Tau seeds. Consistent with this, accumulation of Tau co-localized with DOs positive for LysoTracker, for DOs stained with LAMP1 antibodies, and for DOs positive for the ectopic expression of TMEM192. Overall, our data demonstrated aberrant accumulation of Tau in acidic DOs of primary human fibroblasts.

**Inhibition of GCase activity induces an increase of Tau accumulation in DOs**
We rationalized that lysosomal stress, such as due to GCase impairment, may impact on the accumulation of Tau in DOs. So, we cultured the cells in the presence of conduritol-β-epoxide (CBE), an irreversible inhibitor of GCase. We first showed that one hour treatment with 0.5 µM CBE blocked GCase activity in fibroblasts. For this we used a cytofluorimetric assay for GCase activity with PFD-F dβGluP, a modified substrate of GCase that becomes fluorescent once metabolized by GCase. Overnight CBE treatment of fibroblasts expressing Tau-mCherry ultimately caused a cell response in terms of increased number of LysoTracker-positive DOs. In absence of Tau induction, we did not observe a statistically significant effect of CBE on DO number, thereby demonstrating a synergistic effect on the number of LysoTracker-positive DOs, a surrogate marker of lysosomal stress, due to the concomitant inhibition of GCase and the presence of Tau.

GCase impairment affects lipid metabolism in lysosomes. Indeed, CBE treatment led to the appearance of DOs positive for BODIPY FL C5-lactosylceramide. The presence of Tau did not affect the CBE-mediated increase in BODIPY FL C5-lactosylceramide within DOs. However, Tau expression induced a CBE-dependent lysosomal stress, as judged by increased LysoTracker-positive DOs. Importantly, Tau-mCherry puncta accumulated in cells with CBE-inhibited GCase relative to non-inhibited controls, indicating that lysosomal dysfunction caused Tau accumulation.

**Seeded Tau accumulation in lysosomes induce lysosomal dysfunction/stress**
Next, we assessed the possible association of GCase inhibition to seed-induced Tau accumulation in DOs. First, we found that the addition of Tau seeds to Tau-mCherry expressing fibroblasts, but not in the absence of Tau expression induction, increased the formation of DOs positive for BODIPY FL C5-lactosylceramide. Again, Tau seeds promoted the accumulation of Tau-mCherry in puncta, which appeared to colocalize with the BODIPY FL C5-lactosylceramide positive DOs. These data indicated that Tau accumulation in the presence of extracellular AD brain seeds, induced a lysosomal dysfunction in terms of lipid metabolism as shown by the concomitant accumulation of BODIPY FL C5-lactosylceramide. A surrogate marker of lysosomal stress response is the nuclear translocation of TFE3, a master regulator potentiating lysosomal biogenesis and autophagic activity e.g., following treatment with the mTOR inhibitor KU-0063794. Nuclear translocation of TFE3 was also observed when cells were incubated with Tau seeds, whereas Tau expression and Tau accumulation further increased this cell response. These data demonstrated that Tau accumulation in DOs contributed to a lysosomal stress response in primary fibroblasts.

#### Discussion
We found evidence of aberrant Tau accumulation linked to lysosomal stress in primary human fibroblasts expressing various fluorescent forms of Tau. This adverse process was promoted by the presence of AD brain-derived Tau seeds or upon treatment with CBE: a cell-active pharmacologic irreversible inhibitor of lysosomal GCase. Tau was found to be a target for the autophagic pathway and Tau accumulation was colocalized with DO markers (LAMP1, TMEM192), the acidophilic compound LysoTracker, and showed a specific loss of GFP emission characteristic of an acidic environment. Based on our data, we propose that lysosomal dysfunction and the presence of internalized Tau seeds may cause, through an unknown mechanism, the accumulation of Tau on route to degradation within DOs. Similar results were described in murine cells incubated with exosomes containing a fibrillogenic fragment of Tau. Tau accumulation in DOs was associated to increased lactosylceramide and lysosomal stress, indicating that seeded accumulation of Tau and impairment of lysosomal function and lipid metabolism are reciprocally engaged in a sequence of harmful events. Interestingly, Tau seed-mediated accumulation of lactosylceramide in DOs required Tau-expression. This may indicate a preferential patho-mechanism rendering more vulnerable neurons, which express high amounts of Tau.

CBE has been used to generate research models of GCase deficiency in LSD because the extent of GCase inactivation can be adjusted by variation in the inhibitor concentration and/or exposure time in cultured cells and mice. Using a short overnight CBE treatment of human fibroblasts expressing Tau, we observed an accumulation of lactosylceramide and an increase of lysosome number and size. These data are in agreement with previous data reported in two neuronal models of GCase deficiency following a two-week CBE treatment that led to degeneration linked to increased glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine, nuclear translocation of TFE3, LAMP1 upregulation, enhanced lysosome size, number and exocytosis. Also, SH-SY5Y cells treated with CBE presented abnormalities in autophagic flux, ALP, and mitochondrial activity. We monitored Tau-dependent lipid accumulation and lysosomal dysfunction in primary fibroblasts and found that CBE-mediated lactosylceramide accumulation was independent on the presence of Tau. However, the increase of lysosome number and size, indicative of lysosomal stress, resulted from the concomitant accumulation of ectopically expressed Tau. Possibly because of the short treatment, the inhibition of GCase by CBE had a relatively weak effect on Tau accumulation, but showed, for the first time, a direct link between GCase dysfunction and Tau accumulation in acidic DOs. Accumulation of soluble and insoluble forms of α-synuclein following CBE treatment has been reported with some exceptions.

The association between lysosomal impairment and accumulation of pathologic forms of Tau (aggregated and phosphorylated Tau) may contribute to pathology. Indeed, Tau lesions are present in a mouse model of Gaucher's disease, and other LSD such as Niemann–Pick, Sanfilippo syndrome type B, Christianson syndrome and Fabry's disease. Restoring mutated GCase activity with the chaperone Ambroxol or through ectopic expression of wild-type GCase delayed Tau and α-synuclein accumulation. These data support the importance of pharmacologic strategies aimed at increasing GCase activity for providing innovative, disease-modifying therapies for α-synucleinopathies and tauopathies. Promising are also genetic interventions correcting mutated GCase by SDM/CRISPR gene editing or overexpressing wild-type GCase, as well as inhibitors of glucosylceramide synthase.

ALP impairment as a consequence of protein aggregation may generate a vicious cycle boosting proteotoxicity in neurodegenerative disorders. In addition, this may contribute to disease progression by favoring the transcellular spreading of pathogenic protein forms along neuro-anatomical connections by a prion-like mechanism. Indeed, injection of extracellular protein seeds in vivo induces intraneuronal pathology by a mechanism that hitherto remains a matter of debate. Proposed are several mediators such as extracellular vesicles, synaptic vesicle release, membrane translocation, clathrin-dependent endocytosis, or transport of lysosome-associated aggregates through tunneling nanotubes. A role of lysosomes in the propagation of pathogenic α-synuclein and Tau forms is supported by several studies, emphasizing the need to better understand the link between (age-related) DOs dysfunction and protein aggregation. Our study supports a tight crosstalk between GCase activity, DOs dysfunction and aberrant Tau accumulation in DOs, offering new clues for treatment of tauopathies and LSD.

#### Materials and Methods
**Cell culture**
Human primary dermal fibroblasts were isolated from a skin biopsy obtained from a healthy 30-year-old female. Fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS, 1% non-essential amino acids (NEAA), 1% penicillin–streptomycin (P/S) and maintained at 37 °C in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cells were cultured for not more than 1 month. Human HEK293FT cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS, 1% NEAA and 1% P/S.

**DNA plasmids**
The plasmid pInducer20 was the vector for tet-on inducible expression of Tau2N4R in human primary fibroblasts. The cDNAs were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using human full-length templates and specific oligonucleotide primers from parental plasmids already available in the laboratory. The cDNAs were first inserted in the pENTRY4 backbone before recombination with Gateway LR Clonase II following the instructions of the manufacturer.

**Pseudoviral particle production and transduction**
Pseudolentiviral particles were produced by transient transfection of HEK293FT cells with 2 μg of the desired pInducer plasmid and 8 μg packaging plasmid mix. Cell conditioned medium was collected 2 days after transfection and cleared by centrifugation at 300g for 5 min, 4 °C. Pseudo-lentiviruses were 20-fold concentrated with centrifugal filters at 3000g for 30–45 min, 4 °C, aliquoted and stored at − 80 °C.

Human primary fibroblasts (6–8 × 105) were seeded into a 10 cm plate coated with poly-d-lysine one day before pseudolentiviral particle transduction. One day later, cells were supplemented with fresh complete medium and selected in the presence of 0.5 mg/mL genetic"
