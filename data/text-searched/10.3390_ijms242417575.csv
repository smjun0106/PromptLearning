### Abstract
Plants are increasingly used to produce high-quality biological molecules for pharmaceuticals and biomaterials. They can produce therapeutic proteins like Elelyso™, ZMapp™, and Covifenz™. However, market challenges exist. This review explores plant-derived biologics (PDB), advancements in plant-based expression systems, and regulatory considerations.

### Keywords
Plant-derived biologics, plant-based expression systems, plant molecular farming, synthetic biology, genome editing, vaccines, antibodies, therapeutic enzymes, virus-like particles.

### 1. Introduction
Protein-based biologics are the fastest-growing pharmaceutical products. Plants can produce various biologics, including antibodies, vaccines, and enzymes, through plant molecular farming (PMF). PMF offers safe, cost-effective, and scalable production, making plants an efficient alternative to traditional systems.

### 2. Types of Plant-Derived Biologics
Plant-derived biologics include monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, enzymes, receptor modulators, and bioactive small molecules. Examples include Elelyso™ and Covifenz™.

#### 2.1. Antibodies and Antibody Fragments
Plant-based systems produce monoclonal antibodies and fragments, known as ""plantibodies,"" for therapeutics, diagnostics, and research.

#### 2.2. Vaccines and VLPs
Plants can express immunogenic antigens and virus-like particles (VLPs) for vaccines. Plant-derived vaccines offer benefits like reduced costs and improved stability.

#### 2.3. Therapeutic Enzymes
Plants produce recombinant enzymes with improved profiles, such as Elelyso™ for Gaucher's disease.

#### 2.4. Receptor Modulators
Plants produce small polypeptides and glycoproteins like cytokines and hormones for therapeutic use.

#### 2.5. Small Molecules
Plants synthesize medicinal compounds through multi-step biosynthetic pathways. Examples include artemisinin for malaria.

#### 2.6. Bioactive Proteins from Plants
Plant-derived biologics include bioactive molecules like lectins with antimicrobial and antitumor activities.
