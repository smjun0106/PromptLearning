### Abstract

#### Background
The availability of multiple treatments for type 1 Gaucher disease increases the need for real‑life studies to evaluate treatment efficacy and safety and provide clinicians with more information to choose the best personalized therapy for their patients.

#### Aims
To determine whether treatment with eliglustat produces, in adult GD1 patients, an optimal response in daily clinical practice.

#### Methods
A real‑life study with 2 years of follow‑up (TRAZELGA [GEE‑ELI‑2017‑01]) was designed to uniformly evaluate the response and adverse events to eliglustat treatment. This study, conducted in 30 patients across Spain and previously treated with other therapies, included the evaluation of safety and efficacy by assessing visceral enlargement, bone disease (DEXA and T and Z scores), concomitant treatments and adverse events, as well as a quality of life evaluation (SF‑36). In addition, the quantification of classical biomarkers (chitotriosidase activity, CCL18/PARC and glucosylsphingosine (GluSph)) and new candidates for GD biomarkers (YKL‑40, cathepsin S, hepcidin and lipocalin‑2 determined by immunoassay) were also assessed. Non‑parametric statistical analysis was performed and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

#### Main Results
Thirty patients were enrolled in the study. The median age was 41.5 years and the male–female ratio was 1.1:1. 84% of the patients had received ERT and 16% SRT as previous treatment. The most common symptoms at baseline were fatigue (42%) and bone pain (38%), no patient had a bone crisis during the study, and two years after switching, 37% had reduced their use of analgesics. Patient‑reported outcomes showed a significant increase in physical function scores (p = 0.027) and physical pain scores (p = 0.010). None of the enrolled patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events, which were mild and transient in nature, mainly gastrointestinal and skin dryness.

None of the biomarkers show a significant increase or decompensation after switching. CCL18/PARC (p = 0.0012), YKL‑40 (p = 0.00004) and lipocalin‑2 (p = 0.0155) improved after two years and GluSph after one year (p = 0.0008) and two years (p = 0.0245) of oral therapy.

#### Conclusion
This real‑life study showed that eliglustat maintains stability and can improve quality of life with few side effects. Significant reductions in classic and other novel biomarkers were observed after two years of therapy.

### Introduction
Gaucher disease (GD) (MIM#230800; #230900; #231000) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder caused by a functional defect in the enzyme acid glucocerebrosidase (GluCer) (EC3.2.1.45) induced by pathogenic variants in the GBA1 gene (MIM*606463). This defect leads to an accumulation of glucocerebroside, mainly in the lysosomes of macrophages, and causes deterioration of the organs and tissues in which it is stored. The accumulation of undegraded substrate induces a multisystemic disease of variable expression in terms of clinical manifestations, course and severity. The disease is classified into three forms according to neurological involvement, with the most common form being type 1 Gaucher disease (GD1; MIM#230800).

The clinical spectrum of GD1 is highly variable, ranging from mild phenotypes with no clinical manifestations to others with severe symptoms; among the complications, bone disease is the most disabling and painful. In addition, GD is characterized by a latent state of chronic inflammation secondary to macrophage activation, expressed by an imbalance in proinflammatory cytokine production, hyperferritinaemia, hypergammaglobulinaemia, impaired calcium homeostasis and metabolic syndrome, which are likely to influence the development of disease complications.

Treatment of the disease involves two different modes of action. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) was the first to be approved, with two different drugs available in Spain (imiglucerase and velaglucerase alfa), both administered intravenously every 15 days. The second mode of action is substrate reduction therapy (SRT), also with two different drugs (miglustat and eliglustat), which are administered orally.

ERT has been widely used for more than 25 years to treat both type 1 and type 3 patients. The therapy is usually well tolerated and considered safe, but there are aspects not covered by the treatment, such as neurological involvement and, in some patients, skeletal complications. Eliglustat (Cerdelga®, Sanofi Genzyme, Cambridge, MA, USA) is the last approved treatment, available in Spain since 2015 for the treatment of adult GD1 patients as first or second line therapy. This drug inhibits the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase (EC2.4.1.80) by reducing glucosylceramide synthesis and thus intralysosomal accumulation. Eliglustat is primarily metabolized by the cytochrome CYP2D6 pathway and is not available to patients with ultra-rapid metabolism (10%). Results from clinical trials have shown that eliglustat, as first-line therapy or when switching from an ERT, provides an optimal response with improvement or stabilization of clinical features. Following approval of the drug, several ""real-world"" studies have been conducted to determine safety and efficacy outside the clinical trial setting, with similar results.

Several biomarkers have been used to screen for suspected disease and to monitor treatment compliance. Chitotriosidase activity (ChT), cytokine CCL18/PARC and glucosylsphingosine (GluSph) levels were found to be elevated in patients with GD at diagnosis compared to healthy controls and decreased during treatment. Other potential biomarkers, such as chitinase YKL-40, have been found to be elevated in cellular and animal models of GD. In addition, molecules involved in the inflammatory milieu have been identified by gene array in the spleen of GD mice as potential biomarkers, including lipocalin-2 and cathepsin S. Subsequent studies have shown statistically significant differences between controls and GD patients for both YKL-40 and cathepsin S, and in the case of cathepsin S also between untreated and ERT-treated patients.

The regulation of iron metabolism is limited to the inhibition of iron absorption in the intestine by hepcidin, a peptide produced by hepatocytes whose production is influenced by inflammatory cytokines. Significant differences in hepcidin concentration have been observed in GD patients treated with miglustat compared to untreated patients, while no differences were found between GD patients and healthy controls.

The main objective of this project was to determine whether treatment with eliglustat in adult GD1 patients provides an optimal response in daily clinical practice. Furthermore, whether this response is reflected in plasmatic biomarkers and patients' quality of life.

### Methods
The study was performed between May 2019- September 2022 and included adult patients with GD1 from all over Spain who were being treated with eliglustat. Patients were enrolled at the discretion of their physician (in accordance with the indications specified in the SPC of the drug) and on the basis of their own willingness to participate. All participants signed a study specific informed consent, which was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Community of Aragón (Spain). The inclusion/exclusion criteria are detailed in Additional file 1: Table S1.

In addition all patients, previously to start therapy with eliglustat are evaluated by a cardiologist and perform an ECG and echocardiogram, it is a recommendation in Spanish patients before prescription.

GBA1 genotype, clinical data, liver and spleen volumes, blood counts, biochemical and hemostatic parameters were collected before the switch to eliglustat treatment and after 1 and 2 years on this therapy and were provided by the physicians, as well as bone density assessment (DEXA). T- and Z-scores were analyzed taking into account the age and sex of the patients, as previously reported.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was analyzed by the same expert before the treatment change and one and two years later. S-MRI was calculated as previously published.

The CYP2D6 metabolizer profile was assessed in all patients prior to switching, as previously published. In addition, the CYP2D6 activity score was calculated according to the recommendations of Gaedigk et al.

The presence of adverse events during the study was reported by the patients' physicians in a form filled out at the same time that the biological sample was collected.

Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were assessed using the Short Form Health Survey quality of life questionnaire before starting eliglustat treatment and after the first and second year of treatment. This information was compared with general Spanish population data published.

All patients were inquiry about the intake of analgesic and NSAIDs in order to have indirect information about the pain level.

The panel of biomarkers was evaluated at baseline and every 6 months during therapy.

ChT activity was measured by fluorometry using 4-methylumbelliferone-b-D-triacetylchitotriosidase as substrate (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louise, MO, USA), as previously described. Concentrations of the cytokines CCL18/PARC, YKL-40, cathepsin S, hepcidin and lipocalin-2 were analyzed by immunoassay according to the manufacturer's instructions (DY394, DY2599, DY1183, DY8307 and DY1757, respectively, R&D Systems Europe, Ltd). Finally, GluSph concentration was measured by LC–MS/MS as previously published.

Statistical analyses were performed using R software (version R-4.2.0). Descriptive analysis was performed with median and interquartile range for quantitative variables and percentages and frequencies for qualitative variables.

The non-parametric Wilcoxon test was used to assess differences for biomarkers before eliglustat treatment and at one and two years.

For PROs, means were compared by t-test between baseline and two years.

Differences with p value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

### Results
Thirty patients were enrolled in the study. None of the patients were naïve, and most were switched to eliglustat after several years of ERT (84%). All patients had completed 24 months of eliglustat therapy. The median age of the patients was 41.5 (Q1–Q3: 30.50–55.00) years, and the gender distribution was 47% female and 53% male. GBA1 genotype, median years on therapy prior to eliglustat and prior therapies are detailed in Table 1.

Pain information was reported by 13 patients before switching and after two years of treatment with eliglustat. Before the switch, 5 patients (38%) reported pain, two of them diffuse and three localized. After two years of treatment, 5 patients also reported pain, but two of them did not before the switch, both reporting localized pain. In addition, two patients did not report pain after the switch, one with diffuse and one with localized pain before the switch.

Information about fatigue was reported by 12 patients, 5 of them (42%) reported this symptom before the switch and 4 of them did so after 2 years of treatment (33%). Two patients reported an improvement of this symptom with the new treatment, while one patient reported a worsening of the symptom.

Eight patients reported intake additional drugs as analgesics, NSAIDs, antidiabetic, antihypertensive or antidepressants. A 37% reduction in analgesic drug use two years after switching were reported in these patients.

At the time of inclusion, 23% of patients had comorbidities such as diabetes, arterial hypertension or cardiovascular event, previous neoplasia.

Four of the patients underwent splenectomy prior to conversion (13%) and were excluded from the assessment of splenomegaly. Of the remaining patients, only 17 reported information on the spleen, with mild enlargement in 7 patients (41%) before the switch and maintained in the same patients after one and two years of treatment. 15 patients reported information on liver size, only one of them had a mild hepatomegaly that was reduced after two years of treatment.

In Table 2 we have detailed the clinical manifestations collected by the physicians during the baseline and follow-up visits.

In terms of global bone involvement, the mean S-MRI at baseline was 5.2 (Q1–Q3: 3.34–7.08), after 1 year of therapy it was 4.7 (Q1–Q3: 2.86–6.45) (p = 0.008316) and after 2 years of eliglustat therapy it decreased to 4.2 (Q1–Q3: 2.57–6.05) (p = 0.003434). It should be noted that more than 50% of patients had residual bone complications such as avascular necrosis, infarcts, joint replacement that are not reversible.

Eight patients report information on bone mineral density assessment before switching and after two years of treatment. One patient (13%) recovered from osteoporotic status to normal, while two (25%) deteriorated from normal status to osteopenia. 5 patients (62%) maintained their DEXA values without changes since the switch.

T and Z values at the lumbar spine were reported by 7 patients before the switch and after two years. Three of them met the evaluation criteria for T-score, with values of -1.3 (− 1.86/− 0.62) before the switch and − 2.2 (− 2.45/− 1.95) two years after the switch. The other 5 patients had Z-scores in the same range, with median and interquartile range values of − 1.6 (− 1.95/− 1.55) and − 0.5 (− 1.40/− 0.25) before and after 2 years, respectively. The differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.180 and p = 0.285, respectively).

During the first year of treatment with eliglustat, patients generally reported good tolerability with mild and transient adverse events. After two years of treatment with eliglustat, only 26 patients reported adverse events. Grade 1 dyspepsia was reported by 27% (7/26) of patients, dry skin by 11% (3/26), and anxiety, hallucinations, headache, and constipation by 4% (1/26) each. One patient had a Helycobacter pilory infection.

As the study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, physicians were asked for information on whether any patients had developed severe symptoms of COVID-19 or undergone changes in GD treatment, during lockdown in Spain. During the first 12 months, none of the patients experienced symptoms of COVID19 or a change in treatment regimen. After two years, most patients had adhered to the established vaccination schedule and 7 patients reported mild coronavirus infection.

At baseline, both physical and mental health domains showed significant differences between GD patients compared to the Spanish general population. The main differences were observed in physical functioning, bodily pain, general health, vitality and emotional role. The comparative study was conducted between baseline and after two years of eliglustat therapy. A significant increase in physical function (p = 0.027), bodily pain (p = 0.010) and a trend in mental health (p = 0.067) was observed in this cohort after two years of eliglustat therapy compared to baseline.

Hematological and biochemical information was collected before the treatment switch, at 12 months, and at 24 months on the new therapy.

Most of the values were in the normal range before starting eliglustat, with the exception of glucose and ferritin, both of which increased when compared to normal ranges for the adult population. The mean of the collected analytical data remained stable after two years of therapy.

Ferritin was higher than reference values, with a greater increase in men than in women. After 24 months of eliglustat treatment, levels were close to the normal range, with a notable decrease in men. Protein profile data showed two patients with gammopathies at baseline (7%), one monoclonal and the other polyclonal. Table 3. Analytical results.

At the first year checkpoint, two patients were lost to follow-up due to COVID-19 lockdown.

ChT activity Chitotriosidase activity was null in three of the included patients. They were excluded from the analysis of this biomarker.

Three of the patients have normal levels for this biomarker before switching to eliglustat (10%), but after one year of treatment, only one patient maintained levels in the normal range, while the other two patients increased their levels. After two years of treatment, three patients returned to the normal range and three others reached it (20%; 6 patients).

After the first year of treatment with eliglustat, most of the patients reduce the ChT values (60%; 18 patients) with a reduction of about 1.1 fold, which is not statistically significant (p = 0.0714).

Comparing the results before the switch and after two years of treatment, the number of patients with reduced ChT activity increased slightly (63%; 19 patients), with a 1.75 fold reduction. However, this change was not statistically significant (p = 0.1529).

CCL18/PARC concentration Most patients achieve normal levels before switching to eliglustat (57%; 17 patients). This percentage decreased after one year of treatment (50%; 15 patients) and increased again after two years of treatment (73%; 22 patients).

After one year on the new treatment, about half of the patients had a decrease in CCL18 levels (53%; 16 patients), while the other half had an increase, resulting in no change in mean levels (p = 0.2488).

Two years after the change, the reduction of the concentration affects more patients ("
