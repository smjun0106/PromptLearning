### Light and Shadows in Newborn Screening for Lysosomal Storage Disorders: Eight Years of Experience in Northeast Italy

Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are inborn errors of metabolism. They include about 70 different inherited diseases. They are caused by the deficiency or absence of specific lysosomal enzyme or transporter activities. This results in the accumulation of uncatabolized macromolecular substrates within lysosomes. These LSDs can present at any age, with multisystemic involvement and progressive courses. Enzyme analyses on leukocytes/lymphocytes, biochemical assays demonstrating accumulation, and gene analyses can confirm the clinical diagnosis. The treatment (enzyme-replacement therapy ERT, hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation HSCT, chaperones, and gene therapy) can significantly improve outcomes. However, the progressive nature of these diseases makes early diagnosis essential.

Unfortunately, the diagnosis is often delayed because of non-specific symptoms. These symptoms frequently arise when organ damage is already irreversibly severe. This has motivated the development of newborn screening (NBS) programs in the last two decades. These programs use multiplex analytical techniques, such as fluorometry coupled with digital microfluidics (DMF) and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), for the simultaneous quantification of several lysosomal enzyme activities.

In Europe, the first pilot NBS project for LSD was performed in the Piemonte region, in Northwest Italy. Between 2003 and 2005, 37,104 male newborns were screened for Fabry disease (FD) using a fluorometric assay. Twelve positive neonates were identified and confirmed as having a specific GLA variant (1:3092 males). Only one patient carried a variant associated with the classic phenotype, demonstrating a high incidence of later-onset forms. A similar study, using a fluorometric assay for FD, was performed in 2008 in Galicia (Spain) on 14,600 newborns. Of these, 106 tested positive and 37 carried a GLA variant, indicating a very high overall incidence (1:395). However, only one male patient carried a variant associated with the classic phenotype, 11 (including a female neonate) carried variants of uncertain significance (VUS), and 25 carried polymorphisms.

After the development of multiplex high-throughput assays (DMF and MS/MS), these methods were used to screen for multiple LSDs simultaneously on deidentified neonatal dried blood spot (DBS). Pilot studies using MS/MS to assay four LSDs (Pompe disease PD, Fabry disease FD, Gaucher disease GD, and Niemann Pick A/B disease NPD) were performed in Austria and Hungary on 34,736 and 40,024 anonymous neonatal DBS, respectively. Both found an overall incidence of about 1:2300. Subsequently, a similar study performed in Belgium analyzed around 20,000 newborn samples for PD, FD, and mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), using an MS/MS assay to establish reference ranges. The reference intervals were found to depend on sex and gestational age (higher enzyme activities in female and premature newborns). A limitation of these studies is the lack of follow-up data.

A retrospective study conducted in Italy identified a high incidence of LSDs, which constituted the most frequent class of inborn errors of metabolism (overall incidence 1:8275). In 2012, a small pilot program conducted in the Umbria region of Italy assessed four lysosomal disorders (PD, GD, FD, and MPS I) using a fluorometric assay. One patient with GD was found among the 3403 newborns screened.

In 2015, the Regional Health Administration of Northeast Italy expanded its NBS program to include four LSDs, GD, PD, FD, and MPS I, using a multiplex high-throughput MS/MS assay. A second-tier test (2TT) of positive DBS (GD, FD, MPS I) was used to reduce the recall rate. Here, we report our 8-year experience with about 250,000 neonates screened, discuss the role of 2TT, and briefly describe the patients' outcomes summarizing the high and low points of our experience.

The DBSs from 248,616 newborns were consecutively collected from September 2015 to August 2023 at the Regional Center for Expanded Newborn Screening, Padua University Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from parents.

The DBSs were assayed for the enzyme activities deficient in PD, GD, FD, and MPS I (acid α-glucosidase (GAA) for PD, acid β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) for GD α-galactosidase A (α-GalA) for FD, and acid α-L-iduronidase (IDUA) for MPS I) using a flow-injection MS/MS analysis, as previously reported. The cut-offs (0.2 MoM) were recalculated monthly to avoid an increase in false positives in winter and false negatives in summer, due to seasonal changes in temperature and humidity during transport.

Second-tier tests were introduced in 2016 for GD and FD and in 2019 for MPS I. Newborns who had initial screening results below the cutoff for GCase, α-GalA, or IDUA activity were tested for LysoGb1, LysoGb3, and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), respectively.

The DBS lysosphingolipids (LysoGb1, LysoGb3) were measured by LC-MS/MS, as previously described. The GAGs levels were measured by methanolysis, followed by LC-MS/MS, with a method optimized for DBSs based on that developed by Zhang et al.

Samples were collected between 36 and 48 h of life at the same time as expanded newborn screening and sent daily to the laboratory. The DBSs were analyzed the same day and the results, including 2TT if available, were ready on the following day (the test needs an overnight incubation). For recalling samples, the result was available in 8 days.

Screen-positive newborns were referred to our Clinical Unit for confirmatory testing, including clinical evaluation, enzyme activities in leukocytes/lymphocytes, substrate quantification (plasma LysoGb1 for GD, LysoGb3 for FD, urinary GAGs for MPS I, and urinary Glc4 for PD), and mutation analyses.

For PD and MPS I, which can require immediate intervention, results were obtained within 24 h for urinary Glc4 and GAGs, respectively. Treatment was started immediately in patients with infantile-onset PD (ERT) and Hurler disease (ERT + HSCT). In patients with the neonatal form of GD, treatment was started after ethics discussion. The other patients were followed and treated only when symptoms appeared. Newborns carrying pseudodeficiency variants (changes in the gene sequence that result in reduced activity in vitro, but normal activity in vivo) were dismissed. Family members were counseled and offered testing and medical evaluations.

Of the 248,616 screened newborns (119,512 males, 129,104 females), 126 positive cases were referred to our Clinical Unit for confirmatory testing (0.05%). Screening results and patients with confirmed diagnoses are reported in Table 1.

#### Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I

For MPS I, 29/248,616 newborns (0.012%) had low IDUA activity in DBS (range 0.1 to 2.2 µmol/L/h). Of these, 4/29 were confirmed as being affected due to low IDUA activity in the lymphocytes, elevated GAGs in the urine, and two pathogenic alleles on genetic analysis. The overall MPS I incidence was 1:62,154 births.

During the first 3 years of screening (2015–2018, 112,446 newborns), when we only tested IDUA activity in DBS, the recall rate was 0.024% (27 newborns). In total, 25/27 newborns were false positive on confirmatory testing, presenting normal urinary GAGs and genetic variants known to be pseudodeficiency alleles (21 newborns, 18 of African origin) or variants of unknown significance (VUS; n = 2), or were carriers (n = 2) (false-positive rate (FPR) 0.022%, positive predictive value (PPV) 7.4%). The residual enzyme activities in these newborns (0.10–2.21 nmol/L/h) overlapped with those of two true-positive MPS I patients (0.12–0.22 µmol/L/h).

Since 2019 (136,170 newborns), GAG analysis in DBS has been developed as a 2TT. The recall rate during this period was 0.015% (two patients) and no false positives were referred to the clinic (predictive value 100%).

The four affected newborns were immediately investigated and treated. The first patient, a female of African origin (Morocco), had the intermediate Hurler/Scheie phenotype. She began ERT with laronidase (100 U/kg/weekly) one month after birth with good clinical and biochemical responses.

The other three patients (among whom pt. 2 and pt. 4 were siblings), were of Italian origin, and affected by Hurler syndrome. The use of ERT with laronidase (100 U/kg/weekly) was started early. The GAGs normalized, although in the first months of life, the patients developed mild features of MPS I, such as coarse facial features (n = 3), conductive and sensorineural hearing loss (n = 2), corneal clouding (n = 3), and mild dilatation of the periventricular spaces on brain MRI (n = 3). Due to the severity of the phenotype, at 6 months of age, they received an allogenic HSCT. All the patients achieved high donor chimerism and normal IDUA levels. The GAGs remained normal after the discontinuation of ERT, 6 months after the HSCT. Currently, they have no neurologic involvement.

#### Pompe Disease

For PD, 48/248,616 newborns (0.019%) needed to be clinically evaluated. Two pathogenic variants of the GAA gene were found in 16/48 newborns, of whom three were infantile-onset (IOPD) and 13 were late-onset (LOPD) patients. The findings in 28 other newborns included a VUS (n = 7), a known pseudodeficiency allele or predicted non-pathogenic variant (n = 17), or carrier status (n = 4). Four newborns were lost to follow-up prior to confirmatory testing due to their relocation outside of the region. The incidence of PD was 1:15,539 (1:10,309 including VUS), of which the IOPD rate was 1:82,872 and the LOPD rate was 1:19,124. The PPV was 52%.

The DBS GAA values in the affected and pseudodeficiency/carrier newborns overlapped (0.45–1.94 µmol/L/h and 1.14–3.22 µmol/L/h, respectively). Only the urinary assay of Glc4 and cardiologic assessment allowed the rapid identification of the IOPD patients. The molecular analyses helped to confirm IOPD and distinguish the LOPD patients from the pseudodeficient and carrier newborns.

The three IOPD patients were referred between day 3 and day 14 of life. All had increased levels of muscle necrosis markers (CPK 653-1063U/L), uGlc4 (26.5–71.2 mmol/mol crea, nv < 7.4) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (LVMI 128–232 g/m2). In our laboratory, we assayed the CRIM status on the peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and then confirmed it by using molecular analyses (pt. 1 CRIM pos c.1933G>A, c.2237G>A—p.Asp645Asn, p.Trp746*; pt. 2 CRIM neg c.2560C>T, del exons 4-8—p.Arg854*, del exon 4-8; pt. 3 CRIM neg homozygous c.236_246del—p.Pro79Argfs*13). The patients started ERT (alglucosidase alfa, Genzyme Corp.) between day 5 and day 19 of life, with good responses. To date, all are alive (mean age 4.5 years). Two patients (pt. 1, 5.5 years old, and pt. 3, 3.0 years old) have age-appropriate motor development with no signs of cardiomyopathy and normal biochemical test results, including CPK and uGlc4. However, pt. 2, who was CRIM-negative, developed anti-rhGAA antibodies after 6 months of ERT (max titer 1:102,400), associated with delayed psychomotor development and the persistence of cardiomyopathy.

Among the patients with LOPD, the typically Caucasian IVS1 variant (IVS1-13T>G) was the most common pathogenic variant, present in 12/13 LOPD cases, six of which were homozygous. Over 8 years (mean follow-up 3.6 years, range 0.5–7), none of the patients carrying a LOPD or VUS variant developed symptoms and none received ERT.

Among the patients with pseudodeficiency alleles, we found a high incidence of the Asiatic variant c.2065 G>A (p.Glu689Lys), alone (n = 1) or in the complex allele c.(1726G>A, 2065G>A) p.(Gly576Ser; Glu689Lys) (n = 10). Moreover, five European newborns carried the predicted non-pathogenic variant p.Val222Met. Patients carrying a single variant or pseudodeficiency alleles were dismissed after communication of their molecular assay result.

#### Fabry Disease

For FD, of the 248,616 newborns screened (119,512 males), 31 newborns (29 males) were referred for confirmatory testing due to low enzyme activity. The α-GalA enzyme activities in the DBSs of the positive patients ranged from 0.45 to 3.45 µmol/L/h (n = 29, mean 1.45 µmol/L/h, SD 0.82). Since 2016, LysoGb3 testing was conducted on 24 DBSs with low α-GalA activity. The LysoGb3 values ranged from 0.22 to 8.06 nmol/L (mean 1.38 nmol/L, SD 1.74, nv < 1.45 nmol/L). The values were abnormal in seven newborns.

All 29 males were confirmed as having low α-GalA activity in lymphocytes and a genetic variant in the GLA gene, with an incidence of 1:4121 males. The two female newborns with low DBS α-GalA activity were negative at molecular testing.

The molecular analyses identified 18 newborns carrying known pathogenic variants (associated with the later-onset form of FD), 10 carrying VUS (including p.Ala143Thr), and one carrying a haplotype considered benign (-10C>T, IVS2-77_81del15, IVS4-16A>G, IVS622C>T). The most common pathogenic variant was p.Asn215Ser (n = 5). Other variants were associated with ethnic origin. Three unrelated newborns of Asiatic origin carried the splicing variant IVS4+919G>A, three unrelated patients of African descent carried the pathogenic variant p.Arg363His, and three African patients had arginine substitutions at position 356 (p.Arg356Gln, n = 2; and p.Arg356Gly, n = 1). Among the patients carrying a VUS, one newborn carrying the p.Ile91Thr variant had abnormal DBS lysoGb3 at birth (8.06 nmol/L), which increased during the follow-up (13.62 nmol/L at 1 yr.), suggesting that this variant may be pathogenic. All the mothers were positive for the same mutation as their children.

All the patients participated in regular follow-up, except for four, whose parents refused additional medical examinations. Because all our patients carried variants associated with the later-onset form or unclassified variants, we decided to follow them every 12 months to avoid overmedicalization. After 8 years of NBS and follow-up, none of our patients (mean age at last visit 4.5 years, range 0.7–7.8 years) had symptoms or signs of disease and none had been treated. All presented a progressive increase in LysoGb3, which was abnormal on the last follow-up in 21/25 patients (mean 1.88 nmol/L, SD 2.2, range 0.35–13.62).

#### Gaucher Disease

For GD, positive NBS results were found in 18 neonatal DBS; 16 were referred to our clinic for confirmatory testing, while two infants were lost due to relocation. The diagnosis of GD was confirmed in all the newborns, with an overall incidence of 1:15,539 births. Two newborns affected by the neonatal form of GD were already symptomatic at recall. The other newborns were predicted to have GD1.

The Gcase activity on the DBS in the confirmed patients ranged from 0.38 to 2.3 uM/h, and the value was not correlated with the disease subtype or severity. Conversely, the LysoGb1 in the DBSs from the patients with GD2 were 7262 nmol/L and 1698 nmol/L (nv < 33.31), respectively, while the mean in the GD1 patients was 130.81 nmol/L (n = 14, range 45.55–323). Thus, DBS LysoGb1 at birth can clearly discriminate the disease phenotype. Molecular analyses were available for all 16 patients. Of the two patients with GD2, both of Balkan origin, one was homozygous for p.(His294Gln + Asp448His) and the other compound heterozygous p.Asp448His, p.(His294Gln + Asp448His). Of the 11 genotypes associated with GD1, p.Asn409Ser (n = 17) was the most common allele in our cohort, as can be expected for an Italian population. Three patients carried at least one VUS (p.Thr408Met or p.Glu365Lys).

Except for the two patients who relocated after their diagnosis of GD, most of the patients (n = 14) received follow-up evaluations (mean age at last visit 3.8 years, range 0.2–7.0 years). Thus far, 6/16 patients have exhibited clinical manifestations and required therapeutical intervention. The GD2 patients presented at birth with anemia and low platelet counts, petechiae, hepatosplenomegaly, and cholestatic hepatitis. They were treated with ERT, beginning at 13 and 4 days of life, and they experienced hematological and visceral improvements. Unfortunately, ERT does not cross the blood–brain barrier, and the first patient"
