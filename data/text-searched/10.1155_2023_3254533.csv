### 1. Introduction
Gaucher disease is a common lysosomal disease characterized by a deficiency of acid β-glucosidase. This impairs glucosylceramide catabolism, leading to glycolipid accumulation. Gaucher cells are seen in most tissues, especially the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. Patients manifest visceromegaly, cytopenia, and skeletal lesions. Skeletal manifestations cause pain, disability, and reduced quality of life. Bone changes include osteopenia-osteoporosis, cortical thinning, lytic lesions, osteonecrosis, and fragility fractures. This study focuses on bone changes in patients diagnosed with GD.

### 2. Patients and Method
This review includes data from 24 patients with Gaucher disease type 1, treated and followed at our center. The study spans from 2015-2016 (baseline) to 2020-2021 (follow-up year 5). Patients were followed for at least six years. The average age was 28.7 years. All patients started therapy with taliglucerase alfa; two switched to velaglucerase alfa. The most frequent genotype was p. Asn409Ser: p. His294Gln/pAsp448His. The mean dosage of taliglucerase alfa was approximately 45 UI/kg. Each patient underwent X-rays, MRI, DEXA, lab analyses, and bone pain assessments. The study focused on skeletal manifestations, bone pain, and bone mineral density (BMD).

### 3. Results and Discussion

#### 3.1. Skeletal Manifestations
Skeletal manifestations vary among individuals with Gaucher disease. The most common finding was a reduction of tibial femoral space. Osteonecrosis was found in 36% of patients. Erlenmeyer flask deformity was present in 28%. Lytic lesions were found in 6% of patients. Bone crises were present in 12% of patients at baseline. Less frequent findings included fractures, scoliosis, and reduction of the coxofemoral space. No essential changes were revealed in follow-up X-rays.

#### 3.2. Bone Pain Evaluation
Bone pain is common in Gaucher disease. It typically affects long bones but can occur in other bones. Bone pain was assessed using a numerical pain scale. At baseline, 15 patients presented bone pain. Reduction in bone pain was evident in all patients. Bone crises are accompanied by elevated white cells and fever. One patient showed a dramatic reduction in bone pain over six years. At the end of the study, four patients had mild pain, eight had minimal pain, and two had no pain.

#### 3.3. Bone Densitometry Assessment
Bone mineral densitometry is crucial in assessing skeletal involvement in Gaucher disease. Osteopenia is common in both children and adults with GD type 1. BMD was evaluated yearly using a Dexa-Stratos densitometer. A progressive improvement of BMD was observed over six years. The difference between baseline and FU5 was significant (P = 0.0007). In adults, the average BMD value was 1.024 at baseline and 1.036 at FU5. In children, the average BMD value was 0.702 at baseline and 0.985 at FU5. Significant improvement of BMD was observed in children and switched patients.

### 4. Conclusions
Skeletal manifestations in Gaucher type 1 patients are varied. The most frequent skeletal manifestation was a reduction of tibiofemoral space. Bone pain improved in all patients. BMD values enhanced over six years of treatment, especially in children.
