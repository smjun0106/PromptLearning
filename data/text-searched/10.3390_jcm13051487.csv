### Abstract

**Background:** Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by glucocerebrosidase enzyme deficiency. Hepatosplenomegaly and hematological complications are found in both Gaucher disease and Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency (ASMD). The overlap in clinical presentation can cause diagnostic errors. We aimed to carry out parallel screening of acid sphingomyelinase and glucocerebrosidase in patients with initial clinical suspicion of Gaucher disease.

**Methods:** Peripheral blood samples of 627 patients were collected. Enzymatic activity analysis was performed on both glucocerebrosidase and acid sphingomyelinase. The specific gene was studied in samples with null or reduced enzymatic activity. Specific molecular biomarkers helped achieve the correct diagnosis.

**Results:** In 98.7% of patients, normal glucocerebrosidase activity excluded Gaucher disease. In 8 patients (1.3%), glucocerebrosidase activity was below normal, and genetic GBA1 analysis confirmed the defect. Three patients (0.5%) had normal glucocerebrosidase activity but decreased acid sphingomyelinase activity. SMPD1 gene mutations responsible for ASMD were found. Biomarker levels further confirmed the genetic data.

**Conclusions:** In the presence of typical signs and symptoms of Gaucher disease, ASMD should be considered. Combined screening of both enzymes is essential for prompt diagnosis and treatment.

**Keywords:** Gaucher disease, acid sphingomyelinase deficiency, ASMD, glucocerebrosidase, acid sphingomyelinase, differential diagnosis

### 1. Introduction

Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare, autosomal, recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the GBA1 gene. This gene codes for the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase). The enzyme hydrolyzes glucosylceramide into ceramide and glucose. Impairment leads to the accumulation of GlcCer substrate in macrophages, known as Gaucher cells. These cells penetrate the bone marrow, spleen, liver, and other organs, causing symptoms.

Three clinical forms of GD have been identified:
- **Type 1:** Most common, no neurological damage, characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, skeletal pathology, and cytopenia.
- **Type 2:** Neurological involvement, onset before two years, low psychomotor development, rapid progression, death within two to four years.
- **Type 3:** Central nervous system involvement, slower progression, survival until the third or fourth decade.

ASMD or Niemann Pick A/B disease is caused by mutations in the SMPD1 gene coding for acid sphingomyelinase (ASM). ASM is necessary for sphingomyelin metabolism. Its failure causes lipid abnormalities in the plasma membrane, lysosomes, and cellular signaling pathways. ASMD affects the liver, spleen, heart, respiratory, hematological, and skeletal systems. The presence or absence of neurological involvement and the rate of disease progression make ASMD highly variable.

### 2. Materials and Methods

**Patients:** 627 samples from patients with initial clinical suspicion of Gaucher disease were analyzed. Enzymatic assays of glucocerebrosidase and acid sphingomyelinase were performed. Samples with GCase activity ≤ 2.5 nmol/h/mL were analyzed for the GBA1 gene. Samples with ASM activity ≤ 1.7 nmol/h/mL were analyzed for SMPD1. Genetic and enzymatic assays were approved by the Hospital Ethics Committee of the University of Palermo.

**Enzymatic Assays:** Glucocerebrosidase and acid sphingomyelinase analyses were performed using the Dried Blood Filter Paper test. DNA extraction was performed using EZ1 Advanced XL automatic extractor. Long PCR method was used to identify specific mutations of GBA1 and SMPD1.

**Biomarkers Assays:** Detection of glucosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb1), lysosphingomyelin-509 (Lyso SM-509), and lysosphingomyelin (Lyso SM) was performed using the LC-MS/MS technique.

### 3. Results

**Subjects:** 627 subjects (average age: 56.3 years, 58.5% males, 41.5% females) with clinical manifestations attributable to Gaucher disease were studied. 70.8% came from hematology centers, 17.1% from internal medicine, 6.8% from pediatrics, and 5.3% from other centers.

**Enzymatic Activity:** In 619 patients (98.7%), normal glucocerebrosidase activity excluded Gaucher disease. In 8 patients (1.3%), deficient glucocerebrosidase activity confirmed GD. In 624 patients (99.5%), normal acid sphingomyelinase activity was found. In 3 patients (0.5%), normal glucocerebrosidase activity and reduced acid sphingomyelinase activity indicated ASMD. SMPD1 gene mutations were found in these patients.

**Case Studies:**
- **Patient 1:** 64-year-old man with moderate hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and Gaucher-like lysosomal accumulation. Normal glucocerebrosidase activity, reduced acid sphingomyelinase activity, and SMPD1 mutation (c.1799G>A, p.R602H).
- **Patient 11:** 1-year-old boy with severe hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pulmonary involvement. Normal glucocerebrosidase activity, reduced acid sphingomyelinase activity, and SMPD1 mutation (c.1171T>G, p.W393G).
- **Patient 210:** 51-year-old female with anemia, severe hepatosplenomegaly, and recurrent ear infections. Normal glucocerebrosidase activity, reduced acid sphingomyelinase activity, and SMPD1 mutation (c.1829_1831del, p.Arg610del).

### 4. Discussion

Gaucher disease is a rare enzymopathy with an incidence of 1/40,000 to 1/60,000 in the general population. ASMD has an estimated incidence of ~1:100,000. Both pathologies have similar clinical features such as hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pulmonary involvement. Differential diagnosis should be part of common clinical practice in all patients with these signs and symptoms.

The inclusion of GD in differential diagnosis has been extensively implemented in high-risk populations. Several algorithms have provided tools for diagnosing late-onset forms of GD and ASMD. Our study analyzed both pathologies in 627 patients. In 8 patients, glucocerebrosidase activity was reduced, confirming GD. In 3 patients, normal glucocerebrosidase activity and reduced acid sphingomyelinase activity indicated ASMD. Combined screening of both enzymes is essential for prompt diagnosis and treatment.
