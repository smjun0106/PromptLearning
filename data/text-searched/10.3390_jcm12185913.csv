## Real-World Experiences with Taliglucerase Alfa Home Infusions for Patients with Gaucher Disease: A Global Cohort Study

### Introduction
Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GBA1 gene. These mutations lead to a deficiency of glucocerebrosidase activity, resulting in the toxic accumulation of glucocerebroside lipids in various organs. Treatments for GD include enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and substrate reduction therapy (SRT). ERTs provide the deficient enzyme and are administered intravenously (IV) every other week. SRTs are oral drugs that reduce the substrate level of the deficient enzyme. Three ERTs are currently available: imiglucerase, velaglucerase alfa, and taliglucerase alfa.

### Home Infusions
IV ERT every other week in a hospital setting can adversely impact patients' quality of life. Home infusions are an appreciated option for patients. In Israel, the US, Brazil, and Australia, home infusions have been available for years. In other countries, such as Italy, ERT administration is allowed only at medical centers.

### Literature Review
The literature on home ERT infusions is limited. Safety data for home infusions of alglucerase and velaglucerase alfa have been published. For velaglucerase alfa, 104 patients showed similar infusion-related adverse events (IRAEs) at home and in medical centers. No serious adverse events (AEs) were reported in a study involving 174 Israeli patients receiving home infusions of velaglucerase alfa.

### Taliglucerase Alfa Home Infusions
Data on the safety of taliglucerase alfa home infusions have not been reported until now. The overall safety and tolerability of taliglucerase alfa in GD patients are well established. Pfizer has been offering home therapy service for taliglucerase alfa in Israel, the US, Brazil, and Australia. The goal of this study was to assess the duration, compliance, and safety of home infusions with taliglucerase alfa in these countries.

### Study Population
The study included 173 patients who received ≥1 home infusion of taliglucerase alfa between the initiation of the home infusion program and 30 June 2021. The cohort included more female than male patients. The median age at the time of home therapy initiation was 38 years. Approximately two-thirds of the patients were <50 years old.

### Treatment Duration and Compliance
More than half of the patients received taliglucerase alfa infusions for a total of ≥5 years. The median duration of taliglucerase alfa treatment through the home infusion program was 2.7 years. In the US and Israel, the median treatment duration was the longest. Overall, 84 patients received home infusions of taliglucerase alfa for ≥3 years.

### Safety Analysis
The study identified 33 cases classified as either ""definite"" or ""possible"" home use. Fourteen cases were considered serious, and none were fatal. The most frequently reported AEs included fatigue, pain in extremities, bone pain, arthralgia, infusion-related reaction, pruritus, and chest discomfort. Twelve serious AEs in five cases were considered treatment-related. Nine cases reported serious events not related to taliglucerase alfa treatment.

### Conclusion
The analysis demonstrates that home infusions of taliglucerase alfa are feasible, safe, and associated with high compliance rates. The safety profile in the home setting is consistent with that observed in the clinical setting. Home infusions offer advantages such as patient convenience, improved quality of life, and high compliance. During a pandemic, home infusions reduce patients' infection risk and promote continuity of care. The study's strengths include its representation of real-world data from four countries. Limitations include the design and reliability of post-marketing AE reporting. The study was exempt from IRB approval as all patients provided written informed consent for data collection.

### Summary
This global cohort study involving 173 patients from Israel, the US, Australia, and Brazil, who received over 10,000 home infusions of taliglucerase alfa, demonstrates that such infusions are feasible, safe, and associated with high compliance rates. During a global health crisis, a home infusion option is crucial for safe and uninterrupted medical care for GD patients on ERT."
