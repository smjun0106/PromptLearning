### Abstract
**Background:** Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare autosomal recessive inherited lysosomal storage disorder. It involves the liver, spleen, lung, bone, bone marrow, and central nervous system. GD associated with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is seldom reported.

**Case presentation:** A 35-year-old man with GD presented with hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, bone destruction, myelofibrosis, and MPGN. Renal biopsy revealed MPGN and Gaucher cells in the glomeruli capillaries. β-glucosidase activity was 1.95nmol/1 h/mg. Gene detection showed a homozygous pathogenic variant Leu483Pro in GBA. He was treated with oral prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil. His ascites and renal outcomes significantly improved.

**Conclusions:** Prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil may be an optional therapy for GD patients without access to enzyme treatment.

### Background
Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder. The incidence ranges from 0.70 to 1.75 per 100,000, reaching 118 per 100,000 in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. It is caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (β-glucosidase) and accumulation of glucosylceramide in macrophages (Gaucher cells). The disease involves the liver, spleen, lung, bone, bone marrow, and central nervous system. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and substrate reduction therapy (SRT) are accepted treatments for GD. Renal involvement in GD is rarely reported. This case describes a 35-year-old man with GD, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, myelofibrosis, and MPGN, treated effectively with oral prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil.

### Case Presentation
A 35-year-old man had refractory abdominal bloating for over 20 years, splenectomy at 21 for splenomegaly, and weekly paracenteses for ascites over the past 5 years. He had a 1-month history of edema and heavy proteinuria without fever, dyspnea, or oliguria. On admission, his temperature was 36.5℃, blood pressure 120/70mmHg, with an enlarged liver and positive shifting dullness. He was 155 cm tall with thoracolumbar scoliosis and moderate bilateral lower limb edema.

Initial laboratory values are listed in Table 1. Ascites routine revealed total protein of 7.2 g/L and WBC count of 85*106/L. No remarkable findings were found in secondary causes like diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis B and C, HIV, carcinoma, multiple myeloma, ANCA-associated vasculitis, anti-GBM antibody, or anti-PLA2R antibody assay. Thoracoabdominal CT scan showed diffusely enlarged liver, absent spleen, abundant ascites, and bone destruction in multiple thoracolumbosacral vertebrae, especially in the sacrum and left ilium. Radiographs showed decreased bone density and symmetrical widening of lower femur segments, resembling a ""beer bottle shape.""

Renal biopsy revealed MPGN with infiltrating intracapillary macrophages exhibiting a ""crumpled tissue paper"" appearance typical of Gaucher cells. Light microscopy showed 65% tubulointerstitial scarring with multifocal lymphohistiocytic infiltrates. Immunofluorescence showed subendothelial and mesangial staining for IgG (+++), IgA (+), IgM (++), C3 (+++), Clq (+++), Kappa (±), and Lambda (+). IgG subtype panel showed staining for IgG1(+), IgG2(+), IgG3(+++), and IgG4(+). Electron microscopy showed segmental thickening of the basement membrane (400-900 nm) and twisted microtubules (50-80 nm) in glomerular capillaries. Bone marrow biopsy revealed myelofibrosis without Gaucher cells and negative JAK2-V617F.

Further assessment showed β-glucosidase activity at 1.95nmol/1 h/mg (normal > 6.8nmol/1 h/mg). Gene detection demonstrated a homozygous pathogenic variant c.1448T > C in 1q22, Exon11, p.(Leu483Pro), a missense mutation.

He was treated with oral prednisone (0.5 mg/Kg/d) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, 0.5 g bid). After 8 weeks, abdominal CT showed a persistently enlarged liver but fewer ascites. At 12-week follow-up, his Scr decreased to 82 µmol/L (eGFR 106ml/min/1.83m2), serum Alb increased to 27 g/L, urine protein decreased to 0.8 g/24 h, and β-glucosidase activity was 1.34nmol/1 h/mg. No adverse effects were observed.

### Discussion and Conclusions
Gaucher disease (GD), first described by Philippe Gaucher in 1882, is an autosomal-recessive disorder due to a lysosomal enzyme (β-glucosidase) deficiency caused by mutations in the GBA gene on chromosome 1, containing 11 exons. Over 400 mutations have been described in the GBA gene, with some more common, such as L444P (c.1448T > C) named Leu483Pro in HGVS nomenclature. There are three clinical forms: Type 1 (non-neuronopathic) is the classic phenotype, diagnosed at any age, with an incidence of 85−95%. Types 2 and 3 (neuronopathic GD) are characterized by neurological impairment, with type 2 being acute NGD (4−20% incidence) and type 3 being subacute or chronic NGD (5−30% incidence).

In this case, the 35-year-old man had GD onset before 15 years old, with hepatosplenomegaly, splenectomy, ascites, bone destruction, myelofibrosis, and MPGN. β-glucosidase activity was 1.95nmol/1 h/mg, and gene detection showed variant Leu483Pro, confirming type 1 GD (GD1).

Splenomegaly is observed in over 90% of GD patients, and hepatomegaly in 60-80%. Persistent liver enlargement, with or without enzyme alteration, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and portal hypertension, results from intra-hepatic Gaucher cell accumulation and secondary inflammation. Portal hypertension in GD is not solely due to liver cirrhosis but also splenomegaly or massive liver infiltration by Gaucher cells, especially in splenectomized patients. In this case, peritoneal tap for ascites indicated non-inflammatory ascites, likely related to portal hypertension and hypoalbuminemia.

Bone involvement is common in GD, with 76-94% prevalence in GD1 patients. Skeletal manifestations include bone mass destruction and bone marrow infiltration. Radiological findings include Erlenmeyer flask deformity, osteopenia, osteosclerosis, osteonecrosis, and fractures, predominantly in the pelvis and lower limbs. GD and primary myelofibrosis share similar clinical and laboratory features, such as hepatosplenomegaly and marrow fibrosis, often leading to misdiagnosis. Variables like onset age, clinical manifestation, and negative JAK2-V617F help in differential diagnosis.

Although other storage diseases like Fabry disease frequently affect kidneys, systematic evaluation has not found renal abnormalities in GD patients. Few cases of GD-related glomerulopathies have been reported, such as focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis due to femoral head necrosis, preeclampsia-induced glomerular endotheliosis, renal amyloidosis, and renal failure due to multiple myeloma. Common pathological findings include Gaucher cell accumulation in glomeruli or interstitium. Kidney abnormality in GD may involve immune system disorder, related to reduced Ig inactivation due to liver disorder or combined with hematological malignancy.

This case is the first reported GD-related MPGN. Renal biopsy showed ""crumpled tissue paper"" appearance typical of Gaucher cells, indicating GD-related MPGN. Findings showed immune complex-mediated MPGN.

Treatment of MPGN or ICGN depends on identifying the underlying cause. ERT and SRT are accepted therapies for GD. Common therapeutic strategies for renal involvement in GD include ERT, supportive treatment, or renal replacement therapy for renal failure, but no evidence supports glucocorticoid effectiveness. This patient refused ERT due to economic reasons.

According to the 2021 KDIGO guidelines, for idiopathic ICGN with abnormal kidney function, active urine sediment, with or without nephrotic-range proteinuria, glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive therapy, such as oral MMF or cyclophosphamide plus low-dose glucocorticoids, are suggested. In this case, the patient received oral prednisone and MMF, significantly improving renal outcomes and ascites. Remission of proteinuria and improvement of hypoalbuminemia reduced ascites. Whether prednisone and MMF lower portal pressure, another cause of ascites, remains to be studied. Recent studies confirm glucocorticoid as recommended therapy in severe alcoholic hepatitis and MMF as first-line treatment for autoimmune hepatitis due to their liver immune response inhibition. Unfortunately, portal pressure measurement was not completed before treatment, and further follow-up is needed.

This case of a 35-year-old man with GD1, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, bone destruction, myelofibrosis, and MPGN, treated with oral glucocorticoid and MMF, improved liver and renal outcomes. The case provides more therapeutic strategies for GD1 patients without access to ERT therapy. Prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil may be an optional choice for GD patients without enzyme treatment opportunities.
