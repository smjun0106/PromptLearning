### The role of cardiac imaging in assessing the cardiac involvement of type 1 Gaucher disease: a case report with review of literature

**Authors:** Ahmed Youssouf Addou, Wafa El Mire, Nawal Doghmi, Aatif Benyass

### Abstract

**Background:** Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disease causing glucocerebroside accumulation in reticuloendothelial cells, haematological, neurological, skeletal, and abdominal organs. Cardiac involvement is rare, often seen in type IIIc with valvular and aortic calcifications. Other manifestations include constrictive pericarditis, pulmonary hypertension, myocardial infiltration, and restrictive cardiomyopathy.

**Case presentation:** A 72-year-old with type 1 GD presented with syncope during exercise and three months of exercise intolerance. Echocardiography showed left ventricular hypertrophy, bi-atrial enlargement, and reduced ejection fraction. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) revealed interstitial fibrosis in the basal infero-septal wall. Literature review was conducted due to lack of specific cardiac GD hallmarks.

**Conclusion:** Non-invasive cardiac imaging is crucial for diagnosing, prognosing, and managing cardiac manifestations of GD.

### Background

Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder causing glucosylceramide accumulation in reticuloendothelial tissue. This leads to hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, and neurologic signs. Cardiac involvement is rare, typically seen in type IIIc GD with extensive valvular and aortic calcifications. This study evaluates cardiovascular involvement in a 72-year-old with type 1 GD using echocardiography and CMR.

### Case presentation

A 72-year-old male with type 1 GD presented with syncope during mild physical effort. He had exercise intolerance and bilateral lower limb oedema for three months. Blood pressure was 126/86 mmHg, heart rate 124 bpm. Cardiac auscultation found irregular rhythm without murmurs or gallops. Jugular venous distension, hepatojugular reflux, and bilateral lower limb oedema were observed. Abdominal examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly. A mobile soft thyroid nodule was found.

Electrocardiogram showed focal atrial tachycardia, left axis, left ventricular hypertrophy, and repolarization abnormalities. Laboratory workup showed bi-cytopenia, mild hepatic cytolysis, BNP level at 590 pg/ml, and very low TSH. Chest X-ray showed pulmonary interstitial oedema.

Echocardiography demonstrated left ventricular hypertrophy, global hypokinesis, and bi-atrial enlargement. Pulmonary artery pressure was mildly elevated. Mitral flow indicated grade II diastolic dysfunction. Cerebral CT scan and supra-aortic trunks echoDoppler were normal. Holter-ECG found focal atrial tachycardia and frequent premature ventricular complexes. Coronary angiography was normal.

CMR revealed non-dilated left ventricle with hypertrophy in the basal infero-septal wall, mildly reduced ejection fraction, and global hypokinesis. Late gadolinium enhancement showed focal interstitial fibrosis in the basal LV infero-septal segment. Bi-atrial enlargement was noted. Right ventricle was non-dilated with normal systolic function.

The primary mechanism of syncope was hypothesized to be arrhythmic. Continuous heart rate monitoring and Holter-ECG found persistent tachycardia. Anticoagulation with apixaban was initiated. Rate control was achieved with beta-blockers.

### Discussion

Gaucher disease is the most prevalent lysosomal storage disease, leading to glucocerebroside accumulation in reticuloendothelial cells. It is an autosomal recessive disease with an incidence rate of 1/50000. Type 1 GD is the most frequent, especially among Ashkenazi Jews. Cardiac involvement is rare, mainly reported in type IIIc GD with extensive aortic and valve calcifications. Constrictive calcific pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy are rare manifestations.

Pulmonary artery hypertension is rare but well-described in type I GD. Diastolic function may be compromised due to infiltrative processes. Only two studies evaluated diastolic function in type 1 GD. Our patient had impaired diastolic function, recently decompensated by tachyarrhythmia.

CMR was performed to study myocardial infiltration. Similar findings were reported in other GD patients. Enzyme replacement therapy is the cornerstone for treating GD, improving LV function and normalizing echocardiogram.

### Conclusions

Further studies should focus on cardiac abnormalities to establish imaging hallmarks of GD. Non-invasive cardiac imaging, using CMR and echocardiography, provides essential information for diagnosing, prognosing, and managing cardiac manifestations of GD.
