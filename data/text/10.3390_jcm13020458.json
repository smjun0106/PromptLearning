Abnormal hemoglobins caused by genetic mutations affecting the globin chains structure are called Hb variants. The modifications of the Hb structure in regions involving the regulation of oxygen (O2) transport may lead to an increased or reduced oxygen affinity for the Hb molecule and a subsequent impaired oxygen delivery to the tissues [1]. Low oxygen affinity hemoglobins deliver more oxygen to the tissues, reducing the erythropoietin production, and are sometimes associated with a right-shifted oxygen dissociation curve with increased P50."

Most of them are usually asymptomatic, with isolated and well-tolerated erythrocytosis on the hematology tests, or present a mild phenotype (Table 2) [7]. At times, the clinical course may be complicated by symptoms of hyperviscosity, such as mucosal erythema; headaches; vertigo; tinnitus; paresthesia in the extremities; and even, rarely, thrombotic events [6,8\u201310]. Our reported cases 1, 2, 3, and 4 had no symptoms, while cases 5 and 6 experienced mild, occasional headaches. Concomitant thalassemia may worsen the phenotype, as it decreases the amount of Hb A (cases 2, 3 and 4) and in turn increases the proportion of the high-oxygen-affinity Hb. In addition, compound heterozygotes for a high-affinity Hb variant and a thalassemic gene can present with severe erythrocytosis. The proportion of Hb F of case 2 (5.1%) was slightly higher for a β+ thalassemia trait, as were the Hb F proportions in cases 3 and 4 (27.1% and 29.2% respectively), who bore a Hb Crete gene and a δβ0-thalassemia gene. In both cases, the high Hb F values could have derived from the simultaneous presence of the Hb variant and thalassemia. Erythrocytosis is a result of the concurrent presence of a high Hb Crete percentage. It is possible that the type of thalassemia trait (β0, β+, δβ) could be the basic factor that modifies the phenotypes of patients with such compound heterozygosity."

Case 1 was misdiagnosed with a myeloproliferative syndrome when referred to us, although the diagnosis of polycythemia vera did not meet the WHO criteria. As a result the patient underwent hydroxyurea treatment for several years due to erythrocytosis, a treatment which was not needed after the establishment of the Hb Crete heterozygoty diagnosis."

Capillary electrophoresis using the glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) program may improve the separation of some Hb variants from Hb A, so it is better if both methods are performed in parallel. The final diagnosis is documented by gene testing. The diagnosis should also be suspected in patients with elevated HbA1c values if they have normal serum glucose measurements. In such cases, the only laboratory-significant anomaly is that of an unusually high HbA1c value [12]."
