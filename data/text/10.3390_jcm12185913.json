    "text": "Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GBA1 gene [1]. The mutations lead to a lysosomal deficiency of glucocerebrosidase activity and consequently to the toxic accumulation of glucocerebroside lipids in various organs (e.g., spleen, liver, bone marrow, and lungs) [2]. Treatments for GD include enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and substrate reduction therapy (SRT). ERTs provide the enzyme that is deficient/missing and is administered intravenously (IV) every other week, whereas SRTs are oral drugs that reduce the level of the substrate of the deficient/missing enzyme [2]. Three ERTs are currently available. These include imiglucerase (Cerezyme®; Genzyme Corporation, Cambridge, MA, US; Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, 1994), velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV®; Takeda Pharmaceuticals Inc./Shire HGT Inc., Lexington, MA, US; FDA approval, 2010), and taliglucerase alfa (Elelyso®; Pfizer, Inc., New York, NY, US; FDA approval, 2012)."

Thus, an option for home infusions is greatly appreciated by patients, as is evidenced by our clinical experience and as was suggested by a UK study that surveyed patients with GD and Fabry disease over a decade ago [3]. In Israel, the US, Brazil, and Australia, home infusions have been an option for patients (following at least three safe infusions in a hospital setting) for years (in some countries since the early 1990s). In other countries, such as Italy, ERT administration has been allowed only at medical centers."

For velaglucerase alfa, the analysis involved 104 adults/children with GD who participated in 1 of 4 velaglucerase alfa studies and demonstrated that the type and severity of infusion-related adverse events (IRAEs) experienced at home and the medical center were similar. Overall, of these 104 patients, 10 (9.6%) experienced IRAEs in a total of 38 infusions. These IRAEs included malaise, pain, hypertension, fatigue, and headache [4]. Another safety analysis focused on Israeli patients (n = 174) who received home infusions with velaglucerase alfa in the context of clinical studies, the early access program, and commercial use (a total of 13,845 infusions over nearly nine years) [5]. The study reported no serious adverse events (AEs) with velaglucerase alfa infusions and a compliance rate of 98.4% [5]."

The safety profile in the home setting is consistent with that observed in the clinical setting, and with the profile of the patient population (i.e., more AEs were reported in females vs. males and only one case was reported in children). No specific or enhanced risk with home administration was noted (all AEs with causal associations are well characterized as AEs for taliglucerase alfa or as IRAEs)."

    "text": "Our finding that taliglucerase alfa can be administered safely in the home setting is consistent with prior studies examining ERT [1,4\u20136]. Notably, as home infusions are offered to patients with at least three initial uneventful infusions of taliglucerase alfa in a hospital setting, the population of patients receiving home infusions is enriched in patients who tolerate the drug well. Home infusions offer advantages such as patient convenience, improved quality of life, and high compliance [14]. In a recent survey of 125 patients receiving home infusions in Argentina for lysosomal diseases including GD (13% of patients), 88.5% of the respondents considered their quality of life improved, and the most valuable aspect of home infusion (noted by 77% of the respondents) was that the patients felt comfortable receiving the infusion in their own home. Other advantages noted by more than half of the respondents included the ability to adjust the infusion to their daily routine, timetable flexibility, and that the nurse had more time to dedicate to patient care [15]. In this study, the nurses providing the care were also surveyed. From their perspective, for 96% of the patients, quality of life improved. The adherence rate (across all diseases) was 93%, which is consistent with that observed in the current GD-exclusive study [15]. Also, although not evaluated for ERT specifically, home infusions, in general, have been shown to be associated with cost savings [14]."

    "text": "The advantages of a home infusion program are underscored during a pandemic, such as the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, since home infusions reduce patients' infection risk due to reduced exposure. A recent study analyzed the impact of the SARS-CoV2 pandemic in the Spanish GD community through a survey of 110 patients. Of these 110 patients, 40% received hospital-based ERT and 6% received home-based ERT. The remaining patients received SRT (45%) or no therapy (9%) [16]. Interestingly, 25% of the patients treated with hospital-based ERT reported therapy interruptions, and 50% of all patients (regardless of treatment) reported being worried about their predisposition to a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection [16]. Therefore, specifically during a pandemic, a home infusion program could promote continuity of care and improve quality of life by reducing patients' anxiety regarding their risk [16]. Indeed, our findings demonstrate that the compliance rate remained high, even during the COVID-19 pandemic period (2020 through H1 of 2021). Although interesting, health-related quality of life was not captured in this study."

The limitations of our study stem from its design and the reliability of post-marketing AE reporting that is, in general, submitted voluntarily (except for healthcare professionals who administer treatment and are contracted through Pfizer, as those are required to report any AEs they observe). Also, the data had a relatively large number of cases (80) that were excluded due to a lack of clear evidence of home infusion, and AEs in-home use could have been missed if the word \"home\" did not appear in the case narrative. As the magnitude of underreporting is unknown, incidence rates could not be calculated and between-drug comparisons could not be made. Also, due to the study design, causality cannot be established, as the AE may have been caused by the underlying disease, or concomitant medication, for example."
