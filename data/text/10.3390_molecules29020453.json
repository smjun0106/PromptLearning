    "text": "Gaucher disease (GD) is the most common lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) of glycosphingolipids. It occurs at a frequency of 1 in 100,000 live births in the general population and of 1 in 450 live births among Ashkenazi Jews [1,2]. GD is caused by mutations in the GBA gene (mapped on chromosome 1q21-22), which encodes for the lysosomal enzyme acid β-glucosidase (glucocerebrosidase, also known as GCase and GBA, EC 3.2.1.45, MIM*606463). GCase is an enzyme involved in the lysosomal breakdown of two sphingolipids, glucocerebroside (GlcCer) and glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph). Human GCase comprises three interconnected domains: Domain I (residues 1\u201327 and 383\u2013414); Domain II (residues 30\u201375 and 431\u2013497), which resembles an immunoglobulin (Ig) fold; and Domain III (residues 76\u2013381 and 416\u2013430), which contains the catalytic site. Severe mutations in the GBA gene are distributed throughout the three domains of the GCase [3]. The severe neuropathic GD phenotypes may arise from a broad range of enzyme defects involving the catalytic site (directly and indirectly), protein folding and/or stability, or regulatory functions, such as the interactions with saposin C or lysosomal-membrane phospholipids [3]. GD is classified into three major clinical types based on age of onset and neurological involvement. GD type 1 is characterized by the presence of clinical or radiographic evidence of bone disease (osteopenia, focal lytic or sclerotic lesions, and osteonecrosis), hepatosplenomegaly, anaemia and thrombocytopenia, lung disease, and the absence of primary central-nervous-system disease. GD types 2 and 3 are characterized by the presence of primary neurologic disease. GD type 2 (acute neuronopathic) is characterized by childhood onset, with aggressive involvement of the central nervous system, often resulting in death within 2 years. GD type 3 (subacute chronic neuronopathic) is characterized by later onset and a slower progressive course [4]. Additional data on the role of each mutation in determining specific GD phenotypes are needed."

    "text": "Currently available treatments for GD, especially for type 1, include enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) [5] using imiglucerase (Cerezyme®, Genzyme, Cambridge, MA, USA), velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV®, Shire, Lexington, MA, USA), and taliglucerase alfa (Elelyso® Pfizer, New York, NY, USA) and substrate reduction therapy (SRT) [6] using N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ; Zavesca, Phoenix AZ, USA). The goal of both treatments is to reduce GlcCer storage, thus reducing the detrimental effects caused by its accumulation. ERT achieves this by supplementing defective enzymes with active enzymes, whereas SRT works by lowering the rates of synthesis of all GlcCer, thus reducing glycolipid accumulation. These therapies have different disadvantages, such as the dependence of ERT on intravenous infusions usually every 2 weeks and poor delivery to bones and lungs and its inability to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier [7]. By contrast, Zavesca® is given orally and crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier but causes several side effects [7]."

    "text": "More recently, an alternative therapeutic strategy has emerged, namely the pharmacological chaperone therapy (PCT). Pharmacological chaperones (PCs) have been studied as a potential treatment for GD, particularly in cases where the mutations result in misfolded GCase that retains some residual enzymatic activity. The PCs can interact with the misfolded GCase, stabilizing and helping it fold into its proper conformation. This allows the enzyme to be trafficked from the endoplasmic reticulum to lysosomes and resume its enzymatic activity, thereby reducing the accumulation of GlcCer. PCs behave as reversible inhibitors of the enzyme, but when they are used in sub-inhibitory amounts, they can correct the folding and/or stabilize the enzyme's catalytic activity with minimal side effects [8,9]. Trihydroxypiperidine iminosugars, carbohydrate analogues in which a nitrogen atom replaces the endocyclic oxygen, have shown interesting properties as anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-diabetes, or immunosuppressant agents [10] and, more recently, also as PCs for LSDs [11,12]. In the past twenty years, other piperidine iminosugars have been investigated to this aim, such as 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin (DGJ), which was the first oral PC commercially approved for Fabry disease (another LSD) in Europe (Migalastat, Galafold, Amicus Therapeutics, Philadelphia, PA, USA) [13]. However, no PC for Gaucher disease has yet reached the market."

Although noted for the first time 40 years ago, few studies have looked at the secondary accumulation in the central nervous system and peripheral organs of GD patients. Higher levels of lactosylceramide (LacCer) were found in the brain of patients affected by different types of GD, while the concentration of gangliosides was found to be normal but with a higher proportion of GM2 and GM3 [14]. An increase in secondary GD3 was found in the brain of a type 2 patient [15]. Ceramide, dihexosylceramide, trihexosylceramide, and phosphatidylglycerol were found to be higher in skin fibroblasts from patients with GD types 1 and 2 [16]. A clear connection between accumulation of GluCer or GluSph and secondary compounds has not yet been clearly established."

No known genetic defects were found in beta-Galactosidase (β-Gal), the lysosomal hydrolase responsible for the degradation of GM1, which is located several steps upstream in the catabolic pathway of GlcCer (Table 1). Moreover, the ability of a trivalent trihydroxypiperidine iminosugar compound (CV82), which previously showed good pharmacological chaperone activity on GCase [17] (Table 2), to reduce the levels of both GlcCer and GM1 was evaluated. Our results on the secondary accumulation of GM1 are important for the characterization of the downstream pathways in GD and potentially paving the way for testing β-galactosidase as an alternative therapeutic target for neuronopathic variants of GD with unmet clinical needs."

For this reason, the inhibition and pharmacological chaperone activities of CV82 towards the β-Gal enzyme were evaluated. First of all, we evaluated the inhibition ability of CV82 towards the β-Gal enzyme at 1 mM in human leukocyte homogenates derived from healthy donors. The compound CV82 showed a negligible percentage of inhibition (33% at 1 mM; Figure 4A), demonstrating its complete selectivity against the GCase enzyme with respect to the β-Gal enzyme. It is worth noting that the best inhibitory activity does not always correspond to the best chaperone activity on cell lines, as already observed for a series of compounds [22]. Therefore, we tested the ability of the CV82 compound to increase the β-Gal enzyme activity in the fibroblasts wild type (Figure 4B) and Molecules 2024, 29, x FOR PEER REVIEwWith the p.Arg201His/p.Tyr83LeufsX8 and p.Arg201His/p.Ile51Asn muta7tioofn1s4 from juvenile GM1 patients (Figure 4C,D). No enzymatic-activity increase was observed in wild-type and Additionally, we evaluated the effect of CV82 on fibroblasts carrying, at the homozygous state, the c.508C>T (R131C) mutation, which has been proven to be an extremely severe mutation that alters the stability and activity of GCase [23,24]. First of all, changes in primary and secondary storage materials in R131C fibroblasts, with respect to the WT Molecules 2024, 29, x FOR PEER REVIEW control, were monitored by using flow-cytometry analysis (Figu8reof51)4, revealing not only an increase (~20%) in GlcCer storage (Figure 5A) but also a substantial (~110%) increase in The disease severity of LSDs is often correlated with the residual activity levels of the mutated enzyme involved. In vitro enzymatic-activity tests use soluble synthetic fluorogenic substrates in cell lysates, which may not take into account potential enzyme activators and may deliver inaccurate results that may not match the clinical course of the disease. We have recently developed an approach based on specific fluorescence labelling coupled to microscopy and flow cytometry capable of detecting higher levels of accumulated metabolites (e.g., sialic acid, GM1 ganglioside, and cholesterol) in fibroblasts from patients affected by several LSDs, such as GM1 gangliosidosis, Niemann\u2013Pick type C, and sialidosis [20,21]. These methods allow one to directly correlate the amount of accumulated material with the severity of the disease. We previously showed that our approach also turns out to be very convenient to rapidly screen the effects of new pharmacological compounds on the accumulation of catabolites directly in treated cells [20]."

    "text": "Here, our method was extended to fibroblasts from GD patients, not limiting our experiments to measure the level of GlcCer but also that of GM1 (Figures 1\u20133), and to investigate the effects arising from the treatment of the cells with a previously developed PC directed against GCase [17]. The levels of GlcCer were found to be significantly higher in homozygous-patient fibroblasts affected by the mutations of L444P, which strongly affects the stability of GCase by altering the retention of mutated GCase in the endoplasmic reticulum [25], and R131C, which severely alters the active site structure/function of GCase [23]. It is largely known that the L444P mutation has been directly linked to Gaucher type 2 and type 3 [26,27]. The R131C mutant allele was also identified in type 2 (acute neuronopathic) GD [23,28]. Surprisingly, the levels of GM1 also appeared to be dramatically increased in fibroblasts bearing these mutations, up to the levels observed for infantile patients affected by GM1 gangliosidosis [20,21]. Little or no changes in the GlcCer and GM1 amounts were found for the fibroblasts with the N370S mutation, which is associated with GD type 1. N370S has been proven to be a folding mutant in part retained in the endoplasmic reticulum [29]. Our results show that secondary GM1 accumulation is not negligible, and its importance should not be undervalued in the pathological context. Interestingly, the correlation between the primary GlcCer and secondary GM1 accumulation was found to be not very strong, with the amount of GM1 rather linked to the severity of the disease (Figure 5E)."

    "text": "Interestingly, treatment with different concentrations of the trivalent trihydroxypiperidine iminosugar compound CV82 led to a significant reduction in GM1 accumulation without significantly affecting GlcCer levels in L444P fibroblasts. In order to investigate the mechanisms through which CV82 could decrease the build-up of GM1 without significantly affecting GlcCer levels, a direct interaction between the compound CV82 and the β-Gal enzyme responsible for the catabolism of GM1 ganglioside was initially hypothesized. The effects of the CV82 compound on the β-Gal enzyme were negligible, suggesting that the GM1 decrease is rather related to other yet unknown mechanisms that follow the direct action of CV82 on GCase. Additionally, CV82 did not decrease (instead, it increased) GM1 levels in fibroblasts carrying the R131C mutation, which can affect the active site of GCase, possibly leading to structural changes of the catalytic site that might prevent the interaction with CV82."

The accumulation of GM1 ganglioside detected in the two different cell lines (bearing the L444P and RC131 homozygous mutations) could be useful to explain the complex scenario of the neurodegeneration observed in some severe forms of GD. It is well established that neurodegeneration in GM1 gangliosidosis is caused by GM1 storage [31,32]. The here-reported detection of GM1 storage materials also in GD cell lines from neuropathic patients suggests a possible role of this secondary storage material in GD pathogenesis."

The explanation of the metabolic pathways that can give rise to GM1-ganglioside accumulation in GD may provide a solid rationale for a better understanding of the physiopathology linked to GCase defects and of the corresponding phenotypes and be of relevance for other LSDs. If targeting GCase, since the enzyme involved in the primary storage accumulation has not yet led to any treatment for the neuropathic GD conditions, it could be worth trying to target the secondary accumulation of GM1 and find whether any beneficial effects are found in vivo. The results obtained here on the pharmacological treatment of patients' cells carrying mutations that can affect either the stability of GCase (L444P) or the functionality of its active (R131C) might help in the future to establish personalized drug treatments for patients according to their mutations."
