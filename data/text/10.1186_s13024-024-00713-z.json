    "text": "β-glucocerebrosidase is a membrane-bound lysosomal enzyme involved in the degradation of glycosphingolipids, including glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph) [1]. Mutations affecting β-glucocerebrosidase activity cause Gaucher disease (GD), a rare disorder belonging to the group of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs). In GD, the deficient hydrolysis of β-glucocerebrosidase substrates and their subsequent progressive accumulation, especially in macrophages, leads to clinical manifestations affecting several organs and resulting in hepatosplenomegaly, bone defects, anaemia, and lung disease [2, 3]. While less prominent in type 1 GD, neurological manifestations occur in the neuronopathic forms of GD (type 2 and 3) and can include seizure, cognitive impairment, motor and coordination deficit, and psychiatric disorders [4, 5]. These symptoms have been linked to β-glucocerebrosidase substrates accumulation occurring in neurons [6, 7], triggering neurotoxicity, astrogliosis and neuroinflammation in both human patients [8] and mouse models [9, 10]. GBA1 mutations are also the most common genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), increasing the risk of PD onset by 20 to 30 times [11]. About 20% of adult GD patients, including type 1 patients, develop Parkinson's related symptoms upon reaching adulthood [12, 13]."

In both GD and GBA1-related PD, defects in the autophagylysosomal system have been shown to be critical for neurodegeneration [15]. The accumulation of undegraded autophagic and β-glucocerebrosidase substrates accompanies with α-synuclein accrual in the brain of genetic or chemically-induced animal models of PD lacking a functional β-glucocerebrosidase, as well as in cell cultures derived from PD patients [16\u201319]. Interestingly, GlcCer was shown to stabilise oligomeric α-synuclein and, in a sort of positive feedback loop, α-synuclein was able to inhibit β-glucocerebrosidase activity, leading to a worsening of the disease [20]."

However, depleting β-glucocerebrosidase only in dopaminergic neurons does not induce marked neurodegeneration [22], whereas PD human specimens clearly show the involvement of glial cells in the pathology [8, 23]. Recent experimental studies provided proofs for the involvement of glial β-glucocerebrosidase in GD and GBA1-related PD: specific β-glucocerebrosidase depletion in astrocytes and microglia causes neuroinflammation, lysosomal defects, α-synuclein accumulation and altered crosstalk with neurons [24\u201328]."

Myelin is a lipid-rich stack of insulating membranes that allows saltatory conduction of action potentials and protects axons [29]. Due to the biochemical composition of myelin sheaths, oligodendrocytes require a finely balanced lipid anabolism and catabolism for their synthesis and maintenance [30] as well as channels for axo-glial exchange of nutrients and organelles [31] to the cell periphery and axons. Interestingly, GD patients display, at clinical evaluation, white matter (WM) abnormalities both in the neuronopathic and non-neuronopathic forms of the disease [32\u201334], and WM involvement was also reported in PD with relevance for motor performance [35]."

Both chemically and genetically induced β-glucocerebrosidase loss-of-function in oligodendrocytes inhibits myelination and turns out into lysosomal dysfunction leading to α-synuclein accumulation and altered lipid profile. Our in vivo studies demonstrate that oligodendrocyte defects are able to elicit neurodegenerative hallmarks already at 6 months of age, including axonal defects, microglial activation and astrogliosis, as well as behavioural deficits in mice. These findings point at a major contribution of oligodendroglial cells to neurodegeneration upon loss of β-glucocerebrosidase function, therefore highlighting the relevance of oligodendrocyte dysfunction in the onset and/or progression of GBA1-related neuropathologies."

Besides the expected increase in myelin-related protein levels (MAG, CNP and PLP; Fig. 1a, b), Oli-neu cells treated with dbcAMP for three days showed higher gene expression for the lysosomal enzyme Gba1, but not for the cytosolic Gba2, compared to untreated cells (Fig. 1c). Such increase was also detected at the β-glucocerebrosidase protein level (Fig. 1d, e), in parallel to a raise in its enzymatic activity (Fig. 1f). In keeping with the relevance for lysosomal function in central myelin development [46, 47], we found increased LAMP1 protein levels in differentiating cells, whereas the protein levels of a different lysosomal enzyme such as iduronate 2-sulfatase (IDS) were unaffected (Fig. 1g, h). Correspondingly, neither the mRNA levels of Ids nor of the galactosylceramidase enzyme (Galc) were found upregulated (Supplementary Fig. 1a), thus pointing at a specificity for β-glucocerebrosidase upregulation upon myelination induction in vitro."

CBE-treated myelinating cells showed increased co-immunolocalization between LAMP1 and p62 autophagic cargo, with higher amounts of p62 aggregates retained within enlarged lysosomes (Fig. 2g, h), pointing at a reduced capacity of degrading autophagic-related targets."

Of note, the Snca gene, coding for α-synuclein, although primarily expressed by neurons, is also expressed by both immature and mature oligodendrocytes [50, 51]. In agreement with an impairment of the degradative lysosomal pathway, CBE-treated differentiated cells showed accumulation of α-synuclein-positive clusters that were less present in vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 2i, j).

    "text": "Considering the upregulation of Gba1 expression upon myelination induction, we further investigated whether CBE could alter Oli-neu differentiation. Indeed, differentiated cells showed lower levels of myelin proteins, including MAG and CNP, upon β-glucocerebrosidase inhibition (Fig. 3a, b). Such results appeared an effect of delayed myelination, since lower transcript levels of myelin genes including Plp1 and Mag were observed at t3 upon β-glucocerebrosidase inhibition (Fig. 3c), while apoptosis, assessed by both TUNEL assay and cleaved caspase-3 protein levels, was not induced by CBE treatment in differentiated cells (Fig. 3d-g). β-glucocerebrosidase defects were shown to induce global changes in cellular lipid composition [52]. Cholesterol is expected to accumulate due to β-glucocerebrosidase loss of function, pointing to a role for the enzyme not only in sphingolipid but also in steroid metabolism [53]. Accordingly, differentiated cells displayed accumulation of free cholesterol upon CBE treatment, as revealed by Filipin III staining (Fig. 3h). To better address the presence of unbalanced lipid homeostasis, we measured the levels of GlcCer, together with lactosylceramide (LacCer) and globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), as direct products of GlcCer modifications, and sphingomyelin (SM), as parallelly involved in ceramide biosynthetic pathways. Despite not significant, we observed a trend toward an increase of GlcCer and LacCer, as expected, due to β-glucocerebrosidase inactivation, but also of SM, consistent with a reduced activity of acid-sphingomyelinase in impaired lysosomes [14] (Fig. 3i)."

Not only the production of myelin-related proteins appeared to be affected by β-glucocerebrosidase dysfunction, but also compact myelin-related lipids, as indicated by fluoromyelin staining (Fig. 4c, d). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of myelinated fibres sampled from different CNS regions, including striatum, optic nerve and cerebellum, denoted thinner myelin sheaths (Fig. 4e; Supplementary Fig. 3c). Altered myelination was assessed by morphometric analysis of g-ratio, a measure of myelin thickness based on the ratio between the axon diameter and the whole nerve fiber diameter (including myelin). Demyelination was confirmed by increased mean g-ratio in the striatal region of Gba1f/f::cre compared to Gba1f/f mice (Fig. 4f). Interestingly, not only striatum but also optic nerve and cerebellum large caliber axons displayed significantly higher g-ratios (Fig. 4g; Supplementary Fig. 3d-f), mirroring a reduction in myelin thickness. Altered myelination was not accompanied by a depletion of oligodendrocytes as indicated by immunostaining for the transcription factor SOX10 (Fig. 4h). No significant differences in SOX10positive cell density were detectable either in the striatum or corpus callosum (Fig. 4i). Supportive analysis on primary oligodendrocyte cultures derived from Gba1f/f and Gba1f/f::cre littermate pups showed reduced MBP coverage upon β-glucocerebrosidase ablation in differentiating conditions (Fig. 4j, k), as well as reduced number of MAG-positive mature oligodendrocytes (Fig. 4l, m), further demonstrating impaired myelin formation upon genetic β-glucocerebrosidase loss-of-function. Western blot analysis showed a trend in MBP reduction while other myelin-related proteins, such as MAG and PLP1 appeared less affected (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b).

Immunoblot analysis for enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathways of sphingolipids, such as serine palmitoyltransferase, long chain based subunit1 (SPTLC1), sphingomyelin synthase 1 (SMS1), acid and neutral sphingomyelinase (aSMase, nSMase), were performed, showing a trend toward decreased levels of aSMase and nSMase (Supplementary Fig. 6a), sustaining the increase of SMs. Interestingly, the expression of GlcCer synthase (Ugcg) was not altered in Gba1f/f::cre brains (Supplementary Fig. 6b), excluding the involvement of the biosynthetic pathway in lipid accumulation, rather pointing to a catabolic impairment. These results highlight the presence of brain lipidomic profile alterations with dysregulated levels of several species and increased level of unsaturated fatty acid chains, suggesting that a specific β-glucocerebrosidase ablation in oligodendrocytes impacts on brain lipid metabolism. β-glucocerebrosidase deficiency was previously widely associated with α-synuclein accumulation, becoming an acknowledged hallmark of neurodegeneration in synucleinopathies [16\u201318]. Since increased levels of GlcCer were shown to elicit α-synuclein aggregation in GD [19], the accumulation of HexCers (GlcCer and GalCer) observed in Gba1f/f::cre brains compared to controls (Fig. 7a), prompted us to investigate α-synuclein. Accordingly, we detected an increased number of α-synuclein-positive puncta in the corpus callosum of Gba1f/f::cre mice, compared to controls (Fig. 7b, c). Furthermore, western blot analysis of Gba1f/f::cre total brain extracts revealed increased levels of α-synuclein oligomers, rather than monomers (Fig. 7d-f)."

In contrast, a lower locomotor activity in Gba1f/f::cre compared to controls was observed in female mice (Fig. 8h, i). A slight increase in the time spent in the internal zone was also detectable in the last minutes of recording, in females (Fig. 8j, Supplementary Fig. 7b). Motor coordination was not affected in either male or female Gba1f/f::cre mice compared to control ones, as revealed by rotarod test (Fig. 8k, l; Supplementary Fig. 7c, d).

This test showed an interesting, although not significant, trend for both Gba1f/f::cre male and female mice spending more time to find the pellet compared to controls (Fig. 8m, n), thus pointing to a mildly reduced olfactory function. Overall, these data demonstrate sex-dichotomous effect of GBA1 deletion especially in locomotor activity parameters."

In humans, mutations affecting β-glucocerebrosidase catalytic activity are known to cause GD, a rare LSD with neurological involvement and encompassing parkinsonism-like symptoms [10]. Heterozygous mutations are known as the most prominent genetic risk factor for a form of early onset PD, that also has a higher prevalence in GD patients compared to the general population [58]. The mechanism through which GBA1 mutations drive the neuronopathic phenotype that reproduces PD neurodegenerative hallmarks is multi-faceted and not entirely understood [20]. So far, PD has been mostly considered a grey matter disease, but increasing evidence supports the involvement of different cell types in the aetiology of this synucleinopathy. With specific reference to the GBA1 mutations in PD, experimental evidence highlighted an impact on astrocytes, characterised by altered degradative capacity and defective inflammatory response [24, 25] and on microglia, whose ability to protect neurons from oxidative stress is defective upon β-glucocerebrosidase inactivation [26]."

    "text": "In this work we report for the first time a role for β-glucocerebrosidase in oligodendrocytes. Our results show that the loss of lysosomal glucocerebrosidase function specifically in myelinating glia impairs cell differentiation in vitro and the proper maintenance of myelin sheaths in vivo. In vitro experiments helped elucidate cellular processes affected by β-glucocerebrosidase dysfunction in myelinating glia and how this could impact on cell differentiation. Chemical inhibition of β-glucocerebrosidase in the Oli-neu cell line affected the autophagic-lysosomal pathway, as reported for other cell types [16, 48, 59]. Indeed, CBE treatment in oligodendrocytes induced a decrease in the number of acidified lysosomes together with defective degradation of autophagic cargoes, as shown by the increased co-localization of p62 and LAMP1 in enlarged structures. β-glucocerebrosidase inhibition in Oli-neu also induced GlcCer and α-synuclein accumulation as well as lipid dyshomeostasis detectable as an altered cholesterol distribution. Moreover, CBE treatment turned into reduced oligodendrocyte maturation, in keeping with a decreased number of mature oligodendrocytes in primary cultures from Gba1f/f::cre pups, paralleled by an increased g-ratio in adult GBA1 mutant brains, supporting similar effects exerted by chemical inhibition and genetic ablation of the enzyme. Indeed, myelin synthesis widely relies on a functional and responsive lysosomal compartment, as myelin-related proteins, such as PLP, MAG and MOG, are targeted or recycled to the plasma membrane through the late endosome/lysosomal or endosomal pathway [60, 61]. Moreover, induction of the autophagy/ lysosomal process is known to promote oligodendrocyte maturation [62] and lysosomes are increasingly recognized as central drivers in lipid trafficking and catabolism for the production and recycling of myelin [63, 64]. On the other hand, lysosomal alkalinization was recently demonstrated to be sufficient to induce a delay in oligodendrocyte maturation [65], supporting a direct impact of the lysosomal impairment generated by β-glucocerebrosidase dysfunction in this context. Interestingly, disrupted cholesterol trafficking, leading to a punctate distribution as displayed by Oli-neu cells upon β-glucocerebrosidase inactivation, was also found to reduce oligodendrocyte differentiation in an Alzheimer's disease in vitro context, a defect that can be recovered by cyclodextrin that facilitates cholesterol transport to the membrane [66]."

    "text": "The lack of β-glucocerebrosidase is expected to result in unbalanced lipid metabolism due to the accumulation of its substrates GlcCer, GlcSph and glucosylcholesterol [59]. In our models, an altered lipid profile was detectable in CBE-treated Oli-neu cells, and was displayed at a greater extent in brain tissues from Gba1f/f::cre mice. Among the three mentioned substrates, GlcSph appeared the most affected by β-glucocerebrosidase dysfunction, contributing to the increased levels of detectable HexSph species in cells and in brains. Indeed, this is in line with elevated GlcSph levels detected in PD patients bearing GBA1 mutations or in the related murine models. While an accumulation of GlcCer was not consistently reported, GlcSph increase resulted significant and more reliable in different conditions, although depending on patients' age and brain regions [81\u201383]. The lipidomic analysis of Gba1f/f::cre brains showed that, at a relatively early stage in life, several lipid species such as mono- and di-hexosylceramides (GlcCer, GalCer and LacCer) as well as Cers, dhCers, sphingosine and SMs, display a strong imbalance. According to our data, most of the lipid moieties found increased in Gba1f/ f::cre brains are expected to arise from a decrease in their lysosomal-related catabolic pathways in oligodendrocytes rather than from an enhanced synthesis. Indeed, a lysosomal impairment determining a loss of acidification, as seen in Oli-neu cells upon β-glucocerebrosidase inactivation, is at the base of lysosomal storage disorders affecting WM, such as Krabbe disease, lacking functional galactocerebrosidase [84] and Niemann-Pick type A and B, lacking acid sphingomyelinase [85]."

Interestingly, increased levels of dhCer led to neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model lacking the enzyme dihydroceramide desaturase (human DEGS1, Drosophila Ifc) representing the final step of ceramide de novo synthesis [86] and DEGS1 mutations were associated with hypomyelination and leukodystrophy in humans [87]. Moreover, the complex and intertwined fate of glial cells and neurons in the CNS could also account for crosstalks, in which an excess of GlcCer in oligodendrocytes might activate microglia, through specific receptors with a mechanism recently reported to drive phagocytosis of neurons and axonal degeneration [88]. Furthermore, GlcCer can stabilize α-synuclein toxic multimers by mimicking their structure and acting as a scaffold [89, 90]. Additionally, the increase of ceramide species can generate neuronal and oligodendrocyte damage [91, 92] and this was also considered to play a role in PD pathophysiology, as altered ceramide levels were found in post-mortem samples of PD patients' brain and serum [93, 94]."

In the early stages of PD, patients may exhibit hyposmia, sleep disturbance and autonomic dysfunction [95]. These symptoms can then be followed by characteristic motor dysfunctions such as rigidity, tremor and gait abnormalities [96]. Accordingly, our mutant mice displayed altered stride lengths and higher base width compared to controls, paralleled by a reduced total distance travelled particularly in females. Altered stride length and wider base width are often reported in mouse models of PD [97, 98]. While not all the Gba1-related PD mouse models mirror the human gait deficits [99], it has been demonstrated that pharmacological dopamine depletion or dopamine receptor inhibition in the striatal region, thereby targeting the most affected circuitries in PD mouse model, impacted on gait by reducing stride length [100]. As well, it has been also demonstrated that an increase in α-synuclein expression was able to impact on gait by reducing stride length and the distance travelled in open field arena [101]."

Since murine models of genetic forms of PD can require longer time to develop olfactory dysfunction, compared to chemically-induced ones [103], and considering that Gba1 deletion in our model is restricted to oligodendrocytes, it is conceivable that older Gba1f/f::cre mice could display a much aberrant olfactory phenotype. Interestingly, behavioural tests highlighted sex-related differences. In this context, while the risk of developing idiopathic PD is doubled in men compared to women, it was also reported that clinical symptoms can differ, since clinical outcomes and progression appears to be more severe in women than in men [104]. By the way, a gender effect in GBA1-related PD has not been established with certainty yet [105, 106] therefore it is difficult to ascribe the observed differences to a specific cause. However, differences were recently described in microglial response to CBE treatment [107], suggesting that also other cells can account for such specificity."
