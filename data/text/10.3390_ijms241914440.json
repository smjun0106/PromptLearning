    "text": "Gaucher disease (GD, OMIM #230800), one of the most common lysosomal storage disorders, is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the GBA gene. This autosomal recessive disorder due to an enzymatic deficiency of β-glucocerebrosidase (EC 3.2. 1.45) results in an intra-lysosomal accumulation of glucosylceramide (GlcCer, glucosylcerebroside). Glucosylceramide accumulates primarily within cells of mononuclear phagocyte origin in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. During its deacylation by acid ceramidase, glucosylceramide transforms into a sensitive biomarker for GD, lyso-glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1). The accumulation of deacylated lysolipids leads to a progressive disease hallmarked by immune dysregulation and multi-system involvement [1\u20133]."

    "text": "The clinical manifestation of GD varies broadly from a perinatal-lethal form to an asymptomatic form. The classification of GD by clinical subtype is useful for prognosis and disease management. Three major clinical types are distinguished by the absence (GD type 1) or presence (GD types 2 and 3) of neurologic signs and symptoms. Perinatal-lethal and cardiovascular forms represent fewer common phenotypes. Symptoms of the most prevalent type 1 GD may include hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, growth delay, and bone or pulmonary involvement. Most heterozygous mutations in the GBA1 gene elevate the risk of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Even though type 1 GD patients classically do not have CNS involvement, they are at increased risk for developing parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease (PD). Heterozygous mutations in the GBA1 gene cause a more severe PD phenotype and are associated with synucleinopathies in general (Thaler et al., 2017 [4]). However, large-scale studies report that only 8% to 12% of type 1 GD patients show PD symptoms at age 80 years (Blauwendraat et al., 2023 [5]). The rimary neurologic disease of type 2 and 3 GD is characterized by an earlier age of onset and the rate of disease progression, a neurologic involvement including squint, swallowing difficulty (bulbar signs), opisthotonus, head retroflexion, spasticity, and trismus (pyramidal signs), oculomotor involvement, or generalized tonic-clonic seizures and progressive myoclonic epilepsy in some individuals [6]. Type 1 is the most common form in the European and US populations, with an estimated disease prevalence of 1 in 40,000 to 60,000 individuals in the Czech Republic. Altogether, 62 patients were diagnosed with Gaucher disease between 1975 and 2022. The calculated birth prevalence of Gaucher disease was 1043 patients per 100,000 live births, or 1 patient per 95,853 live births ([7]; data actualized up to March 2023). An increased prevalence is observed in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. The birth incidence was estimated to be 1 in 450 in the Ashkenazi Jewish population [8], while disease prevalence reaches about 1 in 800 [9,10]. More than 600 GBA gene mutations associated with GD have been identified (HGMD® Professional 2022.4)."

The clinical picture can vary from patients remaining asymptomatic for decades to children with severe clinical manifestations [11]. Traditional GD evaluation includes indirect markers (liver and spleen size/volume, hemoglobin level, platelet count, and the skeletal system's radiologic and MRI characteristics). A personalized guiding treatment decision should be based on pathologically relevant markers that are ideally specific to GD, play a direct role in GD pathophysiology, do not exhibit high genetic variation, reflect the therapy, and can be used for all patients [2]. Monitoring of the disease progression in GD patients is performed at baseline and usually every 3\u20136 months or in a 12-month period for both treated and untreated patients."

While CHITO has been used as an established biomarker since 1994 [12], some concerns have arisen from its description to the present. CHITO limitations include the increased marker activity in different pathological processes [13]. Moreover, approximately 6% of GD Caucasian patients exhibit no measurable CHITO activity due to null alleles in the encoding gene [14], while the manifestation of GD symptoms is not altered in them. Another one-third of GD patients are heterozygotes for this CHIT1 SNP and thus present with half-normal serum levels [14].

Plasma levels of lyso-Gb1 decreased following enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and were correlated with other biomarker changes [18]. Both CHITO and Lyso-Gb1 reflect the context of GD. They fluctuate in the same direction and can serve as a prognostic and disease-monitoring biomarker in GD [2]."

Indeed, CHITO usage in monitoring treatment efficacy was credited to a substantial body of evidence [27\u201332]. Our results revealed that in patients with long-term therapy (the mean number of years in treatment in the ERT cohort was 15.6 years), a decline in CHITO levels is still evident. However, it reached statistical significance with the skewer slope of the regression curve only within the SRT cohort (the mean of the previous treatment was 2.8 years). We attribute the lower CHITO decrease rate in the ERT cohort mainly to the effect of time; Hollak [27] reported a decrease in chitotriosidase activity of 32% in 1 year, and Vigan and colleagues [33] found in their predictive model based on data from 233 GD patients a 95% CHITO response in 2 years and a 36% response in 1 year with ERT. On the contrary, our patients have yet to reach some sustainable plateau since the start of their ERT/SRT, resulting in a less marked decrease in CHITO activity. The higher decrease rate within the SRT cohort could also reflect significantly higher baseline (at month 0 of the study) CHITO activities in SRT patients. Patients with severe changes in the disease's biomarker levels could profit more from therapy and show more marked changes in biomarker levels or activities. The GBA gene mutation heterogeneity was not equal between our study cohorts (Table 2). Within a limited number of our SRT population, 3 of 5 (60%) patients were of the p.[Asn409Ser];[Leu483Pro] genotype, and one patient (no. 21) harbored a null mutation c.1326dupT, which may be considered even more severe than the Leu483Pro genotype Rec Ncil2 mutation, which is considered even more severe than the Leu483Pro genotype [34]. Other factors one should bear in mind are the different mechanisms of SRT and ERT action, as well as the different mechanisms of eliglustat and miglustat as compared to ERT (as undermentioned)."

Rolfs and colleagues [23] estimated a plasma Lyso-Gb1 level of 12 ng/mL (25.99 nmol/mL) as a threshold differentiating patients with GD from healthy subjects or patients with other lysosomal storage, with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. In a comprehensive review of Revel-Vilk et al. [21], data from 16 of the 17 studies demonstrated that treatment with ERT and SRT (alone or in combination) led to marked reductions in Lyso-Gb1 plasma levels, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and urine [21]. Lyso-Gb1 was also shown to precede and predict the response of splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia in patients with ERT [39]. Our results are in concord with these studies. A decrease in Lyso-Gb1 levels following ERT or SRT in our GD patients proved comparable rate behavior for the marker decrease, irrespective of treatment. As distinct from the CHITO evaluation, regression curve slopes did not differ significantly. Lyso-Gb-1 levels are not hampered by the well-described limitations of CHITO activity [38]. Even though Lyso-Gb1 levels were significantly higher in SRT patients at Month 0, the trendlines of both ERT and SRT long-term patients were closely similar. That is in good agreement with observations suggesting that a significant reduction in plasma lyso-Gb1 occurs after ERT or SRT initiation before stabilizing at a lower concentration in most patients [23,40,41]."

Considering biomarker values, the disease burden, including bone involvement, was significantly higher within our SRT cohort. TRAP activity rises during bone resorption through the degradation of type I collagen by the osteoclast. We can only hypothesize that higher TRAP levels will better respond to the particular treatment. Sims and colleagues [43] evaluated changes in bone disease in 33 patients with skeletal manifestations with ERT therapy with imiglucerase. They studied bone formation (osteocalcin, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase) and bone resorption (N-telopeptide crosslinks and deoxypyridinoline, DPYD) markers. With median baseline measurements of all markers at baseline distributed within the normal range, median post-treatment measurements for bone formation markers were significantly higher, even though some increases were small, and all increased within the normal reference ranges. The decrease in bone resorption markers was not significant; however, their results indicate an alteration favoring new bone formation relative to bone resorption after 48 months with ERT treatment [43]. The effect of SRT on bone involvement in GD seems more complex. Miglustat, acting as a competitive inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, blocks the first committed step in glycosphingolipid synthesis, thus blocking the synthesis of all glucosylceramide-derived glycosphingolipids. However, it was shown to have dual mechanisms of action. It may also accelerate the degradation of the glycolipid complex by increasing glucocerebrosidase activity, which can be additionally beneficial in patients harboring mutations with residual enzyme activity (such as p.Asn409Ser) [44]. Moreover, in a study using human and mouse NPC1-mutant cells, miglustat demonstrated its ability to affect impaired calcium homeostasis related to sphingosine storage [45]. The second SRT, eliglustat, is a highly specific oral glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor structurally different from miglustat, upon which eliglustat exhibits superior potency and selectivity [46]. The eliglustat effect is also weighty on bone involvement in GD. Eliglustat prevents autophagic degradation of TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3), a key step in osteoclast differentiation [47]. This SRT effectively inhibits autophagy in osteoclasts and increases bone mass, thus having tremendous potential for the therapeutic use of eliglustat in bone loss. Taken together, our data could indicate a marked reduction in osteoclastogenic markers in patients with SRT treatment compared to the ERT cohort. Nevertheless, the markers of bone metabolism and their level patterns are complex. Their variability makes their use in clinical practice rather polemical [19,48,49]."

In slow or poor responders, a gradual increase in the ERT dose can increase the platelet count; the other method of choice is to switch to another ERT regimen. Elstein et al. [52] demonstrated approximately a 40% chance of improvement (\"booster effect\") due to a switch from imiglucerase or taliglucerase alfa to velaglucerase alfa. A possible therapeutic benefit of SRT was demonstrated in patients with poor platelet response after 6 years on first-line ERT treatment. After ERT discontinuation, eliglustat was the sole treatment, leading to a good clinical and relatively stable platelet response [53].

On the contrary, patients receiving SRT showed a significant correlation between Lyso-Gb1 and platelet count (r = −0.45).

On the other hand, although platelet count increased with Lyso-Gb1 decrease in the pooled ERT and SRT cohort of 128 patients in the study of Murugesan et al. [2], no correlation between Lyso-Gb1 and platelet counts was found. As tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase is now included in the older and less specific GD markers, the limited literary evidence of Lyso-Gb1 and TRAP correlation in GD patients hinders the formation of further conclusions about its significance. However, regarding all tested correlations, we found the highest correlation coefficient for the association of Lyso-Gb1 and TRAP in patients with SRT treatment.

Continuous variables were presented as a range of values as minimum and maximum, mean and standard error of the mean (SEM), or median and standard deviation (SD), depending on the distribution. A paired sample t-test was used to assess differences in plasma markers over time. Two sample T-tests were performed to test differences between therapies for statistical significance. To describe the relationships between the effects of the treatment and time, a linear regression analysis was performed and a regression equation was calculated. Each point of the regression curve corresponded to the mean of values measured at regular 6-month visits, giving a sample size of 6. Slopes of linear regression curves were compared to determine whether the slopes of the two treatments were significantly different from each other, given the slope, standard error, and sample size for each line (c.f. [57]). The isotonic regression curve was estimated using the pool adjacent violators algorithm and fitted to minimize the mean squared error. All p-values reported are two-tailed, and p-values < 0.05 were considered significant. In univariate analysis, Pearson's correlation coefficient r was used to correlate Lyso-Gb1 against CHITO, TRAP, and platelet count. Statistical analysis was performed using MedCalc version 20.010 (MedCalc Software Ltd., Ostend, Belgium) and OriginPro 8.5.0 SR1 (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA)."
