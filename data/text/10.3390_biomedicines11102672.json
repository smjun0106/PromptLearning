    "text": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disease (LSD) affecting the recycling of cellular glycolipids. Glucocerebroside is ordinarily degraded to glucose and lipid components, while it accumulates within the lysosomes of cells in GD. The incidence of GD in the general population ranges between 0.4 and 5.8 per 100,000 births, with a prevalence of 0.7 to 1.8 per 100,000 [1]. The non-neuronopathic form of the disease, type 1 (GD1) accounts for 90 percent of patients. GD1 is the most common type seen in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. The incidence rate of GD1 in non-Jewish populations ranges approximately between 1 in 40,000 [2] and 1 in 86,000 [3] livebirths. The incidence rate of neuronopathic GD (GD2) is about 1 in 150,000 [4]. The incidence rate of GD3 (subacute or chronic neuronopathic GD) is 1 in 200,000, with a much higher prevalence than GD2 due to longer survival. GD3 is widely distributed in many areas including Northern Europe, Eastern Asia, and Egypt [5]."

Sanger sequencing of the GBA1 gene (NM_ 000157.4) evidenced the pathogenic variant c.1448T>C (p.Leu483Pro). The c.1448T>C variant causes the thymine nucleotide to be changed into a Cytosine nucleotide at position 1448 in exon 10 of the GBA1 gene, causing the substitution of the amino acid Leucine by the amino acid Proline at codon 483 of the encoded protein (p.Leu483Pro). The molecular testing revealed the pathogenic familial mutation on both alleles for the symptomatic siblings. The familial mutation was found in monoallelic (heterozygous) form in both asymptomatic parents and the two older siblings, aged 18 and 13 years, respectively, also asymptomatic. One asymptomatic older sibling was not available for the diagnostic study. Sanger sequencing is described in full detail in the Supplementary Materials, with Figure S2 for the sequencing chromatographs showing the mutation of the GBA1 gene in both GD cases as well as in the healthy carrier collaterals. prevaTlehnet einnvzoylmveemreenptlaocfetmheenlitvtehre,rsappleyen(E,RboTn)eb,yani.dv.hiemmigatluolcoegriacsael (s7y2stUem/k.g every other weekT)hweaesnzsytamrteedrefpolractehmeelintttlethbeorayp(yca(sEeR1T)). bSyooi.nv.thimeriegaluftceerr,aEsReT(7b2yUi./vk.giemviegrlyucoetrhaesre Uv/ekrgy ewveelrlytooltehreartewdeaenk)dwisasstailllsoonsgtaoritnegd, faofrtehris12oladnedr s7isdteorse(csaasdem2)i.nTisrteeartemd,enretswpeacstviveerlyy, diagnBoositsh, ppraotgiernetsssihvaeldy aimrepdrouvcetidonhiosfmliovteorr aanbdilitsypluepentosibzeeindguarbinlegtEoRruT:nl.iver diameter rwedeullc:ecdasien1chasaed1a fsrpolmeen13letnog9t.h5ocfm16ancmd iant cthaesed2iafgrnoomsi1s,1wtohi9lecamt.laSsptlfeoelnloswiz-eupretdhuecsepdleaesn last foFlliogwur-eu3p sthhoewspslteheentdreimndenosfioLnyssowGebr1e l1e1v×el4s.q2u×a2n.t8ificmed. by second-tier testing on DBS samFpilgesuraes 3wsehlolwassptlhaetetlreetncdooufnLtydsuorGinbg1tlheeveclosuqrusaenotfifiEeRdTb,ypasreacmonedte-trisermtoesntiitnogreodneDvBerSy wdeuecktisonatofththeetiamcceumofutlhateedthbeiroampeaurktiecr sinesbsoiothn.pAatsiernetpsrwesaesnatelrdeaidnyFoibgsuerreve3d, daumrianrgktehde rfiedrsutcEtiRoTn aodfmthienaisctcruamtiounlast,ewdibthioLmyasrokGebr1inlebvoetlhs preaaticehnitnsgwsatasbaillrietyadayftoerbstherevfierdstdfuoruinrgtrtehaetfimrsetntEsR.TMoardemovineirs,ttrhaetipolnast,elwetitchouLnytsiomGpbr1ovleedveglsrardeuaaclhlyindgusrtinabgiltihtyeraapftye,rfitnhaellyfirrestacfhoiunrg reachiInngtenreosrtminagllyv,aalugeoso.d and significant correlation between the two detected parameters (LysoGb1 levels and platelet count) in case 1 (Pearson correlation coefficient r =−0.80; p-value = 0.0170) and case 2 (Pearson correlation coefficient r = −0.73; p-value = 0.0147) were found.

Moreover, a global evaluation of GD incidence and prevalence identified important deficiencies in data for specific countries such as for Africa, India, and China [29]. Anyway, Nalysnyk et al. estimated the incidence of GD in the general population between 0.39 and 5.80 per 100,000 live births [1]. More interestingly, a study reported that GD is not rare in Morocco, and type 1 is the most common. This is due to the high frequency of consanguineous marriages [30]."

Two of the mutations, 1226 and 1448, and a new mutation (XOVR) representing cross-over between the GBA gene and its closely linked pseudogene, were found. Based on their findings, mutation 1226 was associated with a mild clinical phenotype, while mutation 1448 was associated with a more severe phenotype. In the present case, homozygosity for the socalled 1448 mutation, now defined as c.1448T>C (p.Leu483Pro), confirms its pathogenic role in causing a \"chronic\" phenotype of GD1, which may be included in type B, with no evidence of bone or CNS involvement during the first two or three years of life [32]. This variant involves a non-conservative amino acid change in the Glycosyl hydrolase family 30, beta-sandwich domain of the encoded protein sequence. As previously reported in the literature, the c.1448T>C variant results in an unstable enzyme with little or no residual activity: in fact, this mutation preserves a residual activity of 13 percent [33]. In addition, several studies reported that the homozygosity for c.1448T>C found in the two affected siblings is usually related to GD3 [34\u201337], although several individuals with this genotype have no evident neurological problems. Neurological signs may appear even years after the onset of visceral manifestations. Therefore, even patients initially diagnosed with GD1 may have GD3 [18]."

Concerns regarding the risk of bone disease and Parkinson disease were also high (60%). Adolescent and adult patients with GD1 may have personal problems and concerns not captured by traditional outcome parameters but are potentially affecting their quality of life [39]. To this issue, starting ERT at a young age may contribute to a better present and future quality of life. Progress in the development of novel ERT modalities might have room for improvement in administration time interval or route of administration. Accumulation of information while monitoring children treated with imiglucerase, in particular details of the time needed to reach normalization of clinical and biochemical biomarkers, is of great interest for the pediatricians [40,41]. Tailoring of ERT for the following decades, and even exploring potential opportunities for oral substrate reduction therapy (SRT), which is currently under investigation [42], might contribute to the development of pediatricoriented therapeutic programs."

    "text": "The present study described the cases of two pre-school aged siblings, presenting with hepatosplenomegaly and cytopenia. The initial clinical picture addressed the suspicion of GD, further supported by biochemical confirmation, through newborn screening workflow, including first- (GBA activity determination) and second-level testing (LysoGb1 quantification) on the same DBS sample, and finally by molecular testing. The pathogenic variant c.1448T>C found in this family is very common in GD, although only 6% of cases bear this variant in homozygosity. Of potential interest, we report the use of DBS samples in the workup of biochemical confirmation and follow-up. Indeed, wider availability of ERT, together with the relevance of an early intervention, raises the interest in using NBS workflow in the diagnosis and follow-up of LSDs, in pediatric as well as in adult age [15]. The use of capillary blood, collected as DBS samples, represents a valid alternative to venipuncture, not only for the measurement of enzymatic activity in the rapid diagnosis of GD, but also for the quantification of LysoGb1 in the close therapeutic monitoring of the affected patients, allowing a more detailed evaluation of ERT efficacy along with clinical parameters."
