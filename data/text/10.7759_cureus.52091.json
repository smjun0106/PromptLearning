In Albania, the absence of a dedicated registry for rare diseases exacerbates these challenges.

This study aims to provide insights into the frequency of these diseases within the adult Albanian population and seeks to underscore the critical need for improved data collection and research in this field of healthcare."

The limited availability of knowledge, guidelines, and specialised training in the field of rare diseases complicates the process of diagnosing and effectively managing these conditions. This knowledge gap is particularly evident in the field of rare hematologic diseases, which are often complex to diagnose and treat due to their low incidence and non-specific symptomatology [4,9,10]."

Secondly, differences in data sources, methodology, sample size, and time periods between our study and Orphanet's report can lead to variations in reported rates [11]."

In comparison, Orphanet data indicate that WM has an annual incidence rate of one in 260,000 people in the USA [11]. Meanwhile, between 2000 and 2019, the age-standardized incidence rate of WM in the United States was found to be 0.36 per 100,000 people [13] and a prevalence of roughly one in 102,220 in Europe [11]. The prevalence in Albania might suggest an artefact due to the small sample size and demographic differences [14]."

LCH is a rare condition characterised by the abnormal proliferation of histiocytes, with a diverse range of clinical manifestations that can affect single or multiple organ systems with a prevalence of one to two cases per 100,000 inhabitants [11], and with an occurrence rate of one to two cases per million newborns each year [15]. The incidence of LCH in our study was lower compared to the comprehensive analysis of LCH from the national registry study from England, covering years 2013-2019, and published in 2022 in the British Journal of Hematology, in adults aged 15 years and older, where the incidence rate was at 1.06 per million [16]. Though it can manifest at any age, the condition is more commonly diagnosed in those under 15 years old [16] with an incidence increasing to four to five cases per million annually. For adults, the rate is approximately one to two cases per million per year [17]. Our findings align with global incidence rates, which suggest a rarity but consistent presence of the disease in adult populations [10]."

Our research contributes valuable data to the scant literature on these diseases in Albania and emphasizes the need for region-specific studies. Such studies are vital in identifying unique epidemiological patterns, which can inform more effective healthcare strategies and resource allocation for the management of rare diseases in distinct geographical areas. Additionally, our findings underline the necessity of establishing a rare disease registry in Albania. This registry would not only enhance diagnostic capabilities but also improve the standard of patient care, addressing the unique challenges faced by individuals with these conditions."
