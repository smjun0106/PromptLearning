Mutant proteins are detected as misfolded by the ER quality management machinery and maintained in the ER, from which they are retrotranslocated back to the cytosol to be destroyed by the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway after a specific amount of time has elapsed, during which the ER chaperones attempt to refold the proteins [9]. Misprocessing of mutant GBA1 in the ER during differentiation into dopaminergic neurons has been linked to ER stress activation and aberrant cellular lipid profiles [10]. Accumulating evidence suggests that ER stress can induce the activation of inflammasomes and contribute to the development of various diseases, including neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders [11, 12]. Although osteoclasts play a critical role in maintaining both health and bone disease, further studies are required to understand the ER\u2013inflammasome interactions and the contribution of the GBA1 disease-associated variant to the development of bone disease in patients with GD and the specific populations."

The results showed that all of these variables were significantly different between cases and controls, regardless of sex (Table 1). A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the impact of GBA1 on osteoporosis. The 8115 participants were tested for the presence of the risk allele (A) of rs11264345, with 51.0% found to be positive. The analysis was adjusted for various confounding factors, including age, sex, BMI, smoking habits, exercise habits, and eGFR. The results revealed that the presence of the risk allele was significantly associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.06, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.02\u20131.11; Table 2). However, a stratified analysis revealed that this locus was significantly different between cases and controls only in males. This finding suggests that the locus may play a role in the development of the osteoporosis in males (Table 2). The risk allele (A) of rs11264345 was present in 51.0% of the 8,115 participants and was associated with decreased bone mineral density (P < 8 × 10−4, OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02\u20131.11; Table 2). Furthermore, the PheWAS analysis of a single variant, rs11264345 (the top variant identified by a genome-wide association study of osteoporosis with a P value of 8 × 10−4 in TWB), revealed significant associations with 5 health outcomes, including blood urea nitrogen (BUN), uric acid, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (HCT), and bone stiffness index (Fig. 1C and Additional file 2). The risk allele of rs11264345 was found to exhibit a significant association with BUN and Uric acid in PheWAS (Fig. 1C). Previous research has linked the presence of splenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, which are all significant clinical features of GD, are correlated with elevated levels of BUN and Uric acid [21\u201326]. Our findings underscore the role of GBA1 in osteoporosis development and demonstrate the utility of PheWAS in investigating the roles of genes in complex diseases."

Our results demonstrated potential linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the two loci, with a D' value of 1, signifying that the variants are likely inherited together. However, the correlation degree between the two SNPs, measured by the r-squared value, was 0.0012, suggesting a low level of LD (Additional file 5) [27, 28]. In a sample of six GD patients, the majority (4 out of 6) presented with the rs421016 genotype and exhibited the rs11264345 locus in the form of the risk TA allele associated with bone diseases (Table 1 and Additional file 5). The remaining patients comprised one individual with missing data and another possessing the R120W/RecNciI genotype, which demonstrated the protective TT allele at the rs11264345 locus (Additional file 5). Based on this real-world evidence, there appears to be a correlation between the rs421016 and rs11264345 loci for the elevated risk of bone disease in patients with GD. Further studies are necessary to validate the present findings and fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying the association between GBA1 variants and osteoporosis."

Monocytes from GD patients showed a higher proportion of mature tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)positive multinucleated cells (indicative of osteoclast-like cells) compared to those from HDs (Fig. 2A). We assessed osteoclastogenesis by TRAP labeling at various induction times, defining osteoclasts as TRAP+ multinucleated cells with three or more nuclei. The quantitative results revealed that the induced monocytes from patients with GD had a significantly higher proportion of TRAP+ cells (P < 0.001 for HD1 vs. GD1, HD2 vs. GD2, HD3 vs. GD3, HD4 vs. GD4, HD5 vs. GD5, and HD6 vs. GD6; Fig. 2B). Moreover, GD patients exhibited a significantly increased resorption area and activity compared to HDs after various induction periods (Fig. 2C, D). Furthermore, the mRNA expression of osteoclast differentiation marker genes, such as Cathepsin K (CTSK), Acid phosphatase 5 (ACP5, also called TRAP), Nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1), Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), and Osteoclast stimulatory transmembrane protein (OCSTAMP), was consistently and significantly increased in monocytes from patients with GD compared with HDs (CTSK, P = 0.03; ACP5, P = 0.02; NFATc1, P = 0.04; MMP9, P = 0.009; and OCSTAMP, P = 0.004; Fig. 2E). Together, these results imply that monocytes from patients with GD drive the functional dysregulation of osteoclast differentiation. We also quantified circulating bone turnover markers in plasma samples from participants with GD and matched control subjects using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). We observed significantly elevated levels of the osteoclastogenic factor receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Β ligand (RANKL) in patients with GD compared to controls (P = 0.03, Fig. 2F). However, there were no significant differences in concentrations of osteoprotegerin (OPG), a decoy receptor for RANKL, between the two groups (P = 0.69, Fig. 2G). Measurements of lyso-glycosphingolipid-1 (Lyso-GB1), a validated biomarker of GD, in plasma samples from patients and matched controls. As anticipated, concentrations of Lyso-GB1 were significantly elevated in GD patients compared to controls (P = 0.03, Fig. 2J). Monocyte's GBA1 protein levels and enzymatic activities were concomitantly reduced in patients versus controls (P = 0.03, Fig. 2H; P = 0.03, Fig. 2I, respectively). Our results suggest that circulating monocytes in GD patients exhibit compromised GBA1 function and are predisposed to osteoclast differentiation, underscoring the complex interplay between GBA1 mutations and bone metabolism dysregulation in GD."

Our findings revealed a significantly higher expression of calnexin in monocytes from GD patients (P = 0.004; Fig. 3A, B) hence confirming ER expansion. When compared with HDs, the MFI of calnexin in patients with GD showed an ER expansion and increased ER stress in the monocytes (Fig. 3C, D) and was significantly increased in monocytes from patients with GD (calnexin MFI, P < 0.001, Fig. 3D). Furthermore, the mRNA expression of ER stress marker genes, such as Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), Tribbles pseudokinase 3 (TRIB3), X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), and Glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78), was significantly increased in monocytes of patients with GD compared with those of HDs (Fig. 3E).

The fluorescence intensity of calnexin in patients with GD exhibited a signature shift compared with HDs (Fig. 4A, C).

To assess cytokines dysregulation, we identified the cytokines profiles in GD patients. Multiplex cytokine analysis revealed that significantly higher amounts of Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, P < 0.05, Fig. 5) and CXC motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10, P < 0.05, Fig. 5) are present in the plasma of patients with GD than the plasma of the HDs. The administration of G-CSF can affect the process of osteoblast formation in the bone marrow by inducing apoptosis of osteoblasts and concurrently increasing the number of osteoprogenitor cells [30]. The CXCL10 chemokine can indirectly stimulate osteoclastogenesis by enhancing the expression of RANKL and Tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in activated CD4+ T cells [31]. RANKL has also been found to induce the expression of CXCL10 in osteoclast precursors [31]. Additionally, we observed a significant reduction in the secretion of Interleukin-9 (IL-9, P < 0.05, Fig. 5). IL-9-producing type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are crucial for resolving chronic inflammation through molecular and cellular pathways [32]. In a mouse model, the absence of IL-9 was observed to result in impaired proliferation of ILC2s, activation of regulatory T cells (Treg), and chronic arthritis with excessive cartilage degradation and bone loss. Conversely, treatment with IL-9 has been shown to promote ILC2-mediated activation of Tregs and effectively resolve inflammation while protecting the bone [32]. No significant differences were detected for other cytokines, including eosinophil chemotactic protein (Eotaxin), Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), Interleukin-17A (IL-17A), Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), Macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β), regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), and Plateletderived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB, Fig. 5). These findings suggested that the dysregulation of cytokines in patients with GD may play a critical role in inducing osteoclastogenesis."

The patients who began ERT early, under 5 years of age, had their DXA values indicating only the mean values for LS L1\u2013L4. Significantly lower LS L1\u2013L4 BMD Z-scores were observed in GD patients after undergoing ERT (P = 0.03, Fig. 7B). These data show that the GD patients who start ERT early maintain normal BMD levels."

Symptoms range from decreased bone mineral density and osteonecrosis to fractures, bone pain, and crises. It has been shown that RANKL-induced ER stress can affect osteoclast differentiation by activating the cAMP-response element-binding protein H (CREBH). Furthermore, the NLRP3 inflammasome interacts with damaged mitochondria, stimulating inflammation [33, 34]. The NLRP3 inflammasome's role may be pivotal in pathological osteolysis, it seems to be less involved in baseline bone remodeling [35].

The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and the diversion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) towards adipocytes are also believed to contribute to GD-related bone loss [37]. Reed et al. investigated the direct effects of glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine on MSCs, osteoblasts, osteoclasts and plasma cells in GD [37]. Also, the phenotype of plasma cells was used to connect the symptoms between patients with multiple myeloma and GD [37]. They hypothesized that excess levels of these sphingolipids drive aberrant expansion of osteoclasts coupled with dysfunctional osteoblasts, creating an imbalance in bone remodeling that culminates in osteoporosis [37]. Crivaro et al. examined how impaired differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts accelerates osteoclastogenesis in GD [38], identifying the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the shift of MSCs towards an adipogenic phenotype as key factors driving bone marrow loss in GD patients [38]. Separately, our group identified a GBA1 variant increasing osteoporosis risk and found it to be associated with severe skeletal disease phenotypes, thereby linking the GBA1 genotype to bone pathology and highlighting the genetic determinants of heterogeneity."
