    "text": "The lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) (EC 3.2.1.45), encoded by the gene GBA1, hydrolyzes its lipid substrate glucosylceramide (GlcCer) to ceramide and glucose. Gaucher disease (GD; OMIM #230800, 23090, and 23100) is an autosomal recessively inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by biallelic pathologic variants in GBA1 that result in deficient GCase activity and lysosomal accumulation of lipid substrates, including GlcCer and glucosylsphingosine (GluSph) [1]. In 2009, a multicenter international collaborative study conclusively established the connection between GBA1 mutations and Parkinson's disease (PD) highlighting GBA1 variants as common genetic risk factors for the development of PD [2]. GBA1 mutations also elevate the risk for dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), providing further insight into the role of GCase in PD-related synucleinopathies [3]. This strong association spurred an upsurge in research on the cellular mechanism underlying the GBA1-PD link, as well as the potential of GCase as a therapeutic target for the synucleinopathies [4\u20136]. With the intensifying focus on GCase, the demand for reliable GCase antibodies for various applications has surged. In 2019, Qi et al. evaluated several existing GCase antibodies for western blotting, revealing that many had limited utility [7]. While both academic and commercial groups have pursued the development of new GCase antibodies, a comprehensive characterization of these newer GCase antibodies for the research community has not been available. The development of GCase antibodies recognizing external epitopes essential for immunostaining, immunoprecipitation, and enzymelinked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) has proven challenging. Here, we report the development of two mouse monoclonal antibodies, hGCase-1/17 and hGCase-1/23, raised against human GCase (hGCase) using the recombinant enzyme imiglucerase as the antigen. Characterization of these antibodies with genetic models, including GBA1 loss-of-function human neuroglioma H4 line and human neurons differentiated from human embryonic stem cell (hESCs), demonstrated their superior specificity and potency in immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and AlphaLISA (Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay) assays. These well-characterized hGCase antibodies, soon available to the scientific community through the Michael J. Fox Foundation Research Tools Program, will prove invaluable for future translational research and biomarker development in the context of GD, PD, and related synucleinopathies."

H4 (ATCC HTB-148) is a hypertriploid cell line with the modal chromosome number ranging from 63 to 78, with most cells having three copies of chromosome 1 and GBA1 alleles. To disrupt the multiple GBA1 alleles in the H4 cell genome, zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN)-mediated cleavage was combined with targeted integration of a gene disruption cassette into exon 4 of GBA1 alleles, following the workflow developed previously [8]. This targeting approach introduced a puromycin resistance cassette into one of the GBA1 alleles (Fig. 1A). H4 cells with the integrated resistance cassette were enriched using puromycin selection, followed by single cell cloning. Established single cell clones were screened for the resistance cassette by PCR and subsequently with an in vitro GCase activity assay using fluorogenic substrate resorufin- -D-glucopyranoside (Res-Glc). The most promising clone underwent Sanger sequencing, confirming frameshift indels in the other two GBA1 alleles. A pair of PCR primers, P1 and P2, were designed to generate an amplicon of 761 bp, encompassing GBA1 exons 4 and 5 for Sanger sequencing. The GBA1 allele with the integrated puromycin resistance cassette could not produce PCR product due to the cassette's size. The Sanger sequencing chromatogram of the chosen clone displayed double peaks near the Zinc-finger nuclease targeting site (Fig. 1B). Parsing the chromatogram with Poly Peak Parser (http://yost.genetics.utah.edu/software.ph ) [13] indicated frameshift indels in the two GBA1 alleles that were targeted by ZFN, but without the resistance cassette integration (Supplementary Figure 2A). Given the disruption of all GBA1 alleles, this H4 clone is referred to as GBA1\u2013/\u2013, or the GCase knockout (KO) H4 line. The GBA1\u2013/\u2013 H4 cells lacked GCase activity in the Res-Glc in vitro GCase activity assay (Fig. 1C). Corroborating the absence of GCase activity, the GBA1\u2013/\u2013 H4 cells showed substantial GlcSph accumulation (Fig. 1D). Moreover, there were only minor changes in the GlcSph stereoisomer galactosylsphingosine (GalSph) in the GBA1\u2013/\u2013 H4 cells, probably due to altered lysosomal homeostasis, indicating specific GBA1 targeting (Fig. 1E)."

This assessment compared these new antibodies with three recent commercial hGCase antibodies not yet independently evaluated: mouse monoclonal IgG 812201 (R&D Systems, MAB7410), mouse monoclonal IgG 2E2 (Abcam, ab55080), rabbit monoclonal IgG EPR5143(3) (Abcam, ab128879), and the well-characterized in-house antibody rabbit polyclonal IgG R386 [14] (Table 1). While 2E2, EPR5143, and R386 detected specific hGCase bands in GBA1+ /+ , but not GBA1\u2013/\u2013, cells in traditional western blots, 812201, hGCase-1/17, and hGCase-1/23 yielded unsatisfactory results despite extensive optimization (Fig. 2A and data not shown). Subsequently, hGCase antibodies were compared in an automated capillary western blotting system (Simple Western from ProteinSimple, Bio-Techne), which automates the protein separation and immunodetection steps in traditional western blot, thus minimizing error-prone steps. The three commercial antibodies and R386 successfully detected hGCase via automated capillary western blotting, indicating their compatibility with this approach (Fig. 2B). Notably, 812201 produced better results in capillary western blotting than in traditional westerns. However, hGCase-1/17 and hGCase-1/23 failed to detect endogenous hGCase in GBA1 + /+ cells using the capillary western blotting system. Hence, the three commercial hGCase antibodies were better suited for detecting endogenous hGCase in both traditional and capillary western blot. In contrast, hGCase-1/17 and hGCase-1/23 exhibited limited utility in western blot, detecting only overexpressed hGCase in HEK293-F cells (Supplementary Figure 1) but not at endogenous levels (Fig. 2)."

Consequently, hGCase1/17 and hGCase-1/23 were compared with 812201 in immunostaining with paraformaldehyde (PFA)-fixed GBA1 + /+ and GBA1\u2013/\u2013 H4 cells. Both hGCase1/17 and hGCase-1/23 displayed substantial selectivity towards endogenous hGCase, with staining confined to vesicular and tubular lysosomes that co-stained with the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP1, correlating with the expected lysosomal localization of hGCase (Fig. 3A). Impressively, GBA1\u2013/\u2013 H4 cells exhibited virtually no background. Although both antibodies were selective towards hGCase, hGCase-1/17 exhibited weaker staining compared to hGCase-1/23, indicating a lower potency (Fig. 3A). Additional assessments of hGCase-1/23 in human neurons differentiated from GBA1 + /+ and GBA1\u2013/\u2013 human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines further affirmed its specificity and potency (Fig. 3B). In contrast, 812201 failed to show specific staining in GBA1 + /+ H4 cells (Supplementary Figure 3). Therefore, hGCase-1/23 emerged as the recommended choice for immunofluorescence assays."

Notably, hGCase-1/23 demonstrated superior capture efficiency than hGCase-1/17, in line with its superiority in the immunostaining assay (Fig. 5A). To further demonstrate their value in studying proteins interacting with hGCase, hGCase in human neuron lysates was captured with hGCase1/23. Then, co-immunoprecipitated proteins were examined for the presence of lysosomal integral membrane protein-2 (LIMP-2/SCARB2), the trafficking receptor for hGCase [16\u201318]. LIMP-2 was co-immunoprecipitated with hGCase by hGCase1/23 in GBA1 + /+ , but not GBA1\u2013/\u2013, neuron lysates, indicating LIMP-2 co-immunoprecipitation relied on its interaction with endogenous hGCase (Fig. 5B)."

It offers a streamlined workflow, enhanced sensitivity, expansive dynamic range, and adaptability for high-throughput applications. In the AlphaLISA assay, a standard sandwich configuration employs two distinct antibodies recognizing non-overlapping epitopes on the target molecule. One biotinylated antibody is coupled with an Alpha streptavidin-coated Donor bead, while the other antibody is directly conjugated to the AlphaLISA Acceptor bead. When the analyte is present, the Donor and Acceptor beads come together. Upon excitation with a 680 nm laser, a photosensitizer inside the Donor bead converts ambient oxygen to an excited singlet state. Singlet oxygen diffuses up to 200 nm to produce a chemiluminescent reaction in the Acceptor bead, emitting light at 615 nm proportional to the analyte amount."

This assay effectively quantified imiglucerase levels, exhibiting exceptional sensitivity, broad dynamic range, and substantial signal-to-background ratio (Fig. 6B). With this assay, hGCase protein per milligram of cell lysate was estimated at approximately 20 ng in GBA1 + /+ H4 cells and around 80 ng in GBA1 + /+ neurons, while GBA1\u2013/\u2013 H4 or human neuron cell lysates showed no hGCase protein, underscoring the assay's specificity towards hGCase (Fig. 6C, E). Imiglucerase treatment increased hGCase levels in H4 cells and human neurons, regardless of GBA1 genotype (Fig. 6D, F).
