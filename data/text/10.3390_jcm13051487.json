    "text": "Abstract: Background: Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by functional glucocerebrosidase enzyme deficiency. Hepatosplenomegaly and hematological complications are found in both Gaucher disease and Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency, which is caused by acid sphingomyelinase dysfunction. The possible overlap in clinical presentation can cause diagnostic errors in differential diagnosis. For this reason, in patients with an initial clinical suspicion of Gaucher disease, we aimed to carry out a parallel screening of acid sphingomyelinase and glucocerebrosidase. Methods: Peripheral blood samples of 627 patients were collected, and enzymatic activity analysis was performed on both glucocerebrosidase and acid sphingomyelinase. The specific gene was studied in samples with null or reduced enzymatic activity. Specific molecular biomarkers helped to achieve the correct diagnosis. Results: In 98.7% of patients, normal values of glucocerebrosidase activity excluded Gaucher disease. In 8 of 627 patients (1.3%), the glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity assay was below the normal range, so genetic GBA1 analysis confirmed the enzymatic defect. Three patients (0.5%) had normal glucocerebrosidase activity, so they were not affected by Gaucher disease, and showed decreased acid sphingomyelinase activity. SMPD1 gene mutations responsible for Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency were found. The levels of specific biomarkers found in these patients further strengthened the genetic data. Conclusions: Our results suggest that in the presence of typical signs and symptoms of Gaucher disease, Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency should be considered. For this reason, the presence of hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and anemia should alert clinicians to analyze both enzymes by a combined screening. Today, enzyme replacement therapy is available for the treatment of both pathologies; therefore, prompt diagnosis is essential for patients to start accurate treatment and to avoid diagnostic delay."

Penetrating the bone marrow, spleen, liver, and other organs, these cells are considered the main protagonists of the disease's symptoms [1]."

The presence or absence of neurological involvement, the extent of systemic disease, and the rate of disease progression make this systemic disorder highly clinically variable [12]. We can distinguish the following forms of ASMD: infantile neurovisceral ASMD, which is the most severe form, rapidly progressive, and uniformly fatal in early childhood [13]; chronic neurovisceral ASMD, which is more slowly progressive; and chronic visceral ASMD, which has onset of symptoms in childhood through adulthood and is associated with significant morbidity [14]. Patients with ASMD have clinical manifestations that overlap with other disorders: hepatosplenomegaly, hematological disorders, and bone alterations are also found in patients affected by Gaucher disease. In the case of chronic forms of ASMD, this overlap in symptoms and signs can lead to a long diagnostic odyssey for patients [12,15]. Moreover, Niemann Pick A/B is rarer than GD, with an estimated incidence between 1:100,000 and 1:264,000 in the general population [14]. Therefore, the presence of several clinical manifestations peculiar to both disorders should alert clinicians to think not only of Gaucher disease but also ASMD [10]."

On the basis of clinical signs, biochemical values, and radiological parameters, our first hypothesis was Gaucher disease with an intercurrent respiratory disease or acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD). Glucocerebrosidase enzyme analysis was within the normal range, while the acid sphingomyelinase enzymatic analysis result was below the normal range. SMPD1 genetic analysis revealed homozygous c.1171T>G coding for p.W393G mutation (Figure 2); according to the literature, this is considered responsible for chronic neurovisceral ASMD in homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations [29]. We also investigated Lyso-SM-509, which was 4.3 ng/mL, above the normal range of ≤0.9 ng/mL."

The acid sphingomyelinase enzyme analysis values were very low, at 1.0 nmol/h/mL (normal range: ≥1.7 nmol/h/mL), which led us to carry out a genetic study of SMPD1, and homozygous deletion c.1829_1831del (p.Arg610del) (Figure 3) was detected.

In our study, we analyzed both pathologies in 627 patients, with a diagnostic hypothesis of GD advanced by hematologists, internal medicine physicians, and pediatricians. In 8 of the 627 patients, glucocerebrosidase activity was reduced and one homozygous causative mutation or two biallelic causative mutations confirmed the initial clinical suspicion of Gaucher disease (Tables 2 and 3). In 3 of the 627 patients with an initial suspicion of GD, glucocerebrosidase activity was normal; nevertheless, acid sphingomyelinase activity was decreased (Table 4). In each of these patients, SMPD1 homozygous mutations were found. Two patients had cDNA point mutations that caused amino acid changes, p.R602H and p.W393G, both responsible for Niemann Pick A/B [28,29]. The third patient had one deletion of three nucleotides (GCC) in position c.1829_1831 of"

Like all metabolic disorders, its complex diagnosis needs to be informed by medical cases, laboratory tests, and instrumental feedback [41]. For this reason, we believe that it is important to carry out differential clinical and molecular study of the two pathologies to avoid delaying the diagnosis."
