This defect leads to an accumulation of glucocerebroside, mainly in the lysosomes of macrophages, and causes deterioration of the organs and tissues in which it is stored. The accumulation of undegraded substrate induces a multisystemic disease of variable expression in terms of clinical manifestations, course and severity [1].

The therapy is usually well tolerated and considered safe, but there are aspects not covered by the treatment, such as neurological involvement and, in some patients, skeletal complications [9, 10]. Eliglustat (Cerdelga®, Sanofi Genzyme, Cambridge, MA, USA) is the last approved treatment, available in Spain since 2015 for the treatment of adult GD1 patients as first or second line therapy [8]. This drug inhibits the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase (EC2.4.1.80) by reducing glucosylceramide synthesis and thus intralysosomal accumulation. Eliglustat is primarily metabolized by the cytochrome CYP2D6 pathway and is not available to patients with ultra-rapid metabolism (10%) [11]. Results from clinical trials have shown that eliglustat, as first-line therapy or when switching from an ERT, provides an optimal response with improvement or stabilization of clinical features [12\u201314]. Following approval of the drug, several \"real-world\" studies have been conducted to determine safety and efficacy outside the clinical trial setting, with similar results [15\u201318]."

In addition, molecules involved in the inflammatory milieu have been identified by gene array in the spleen of GD mice as potential biomarkers, including lipocalin-2 and cathepsin S [24].
