    "text": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare disease resulting from a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) due to bi-allelic mutations in the GBA1 gene [1\u20133]. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of glucocerebroside lipids in one or more organs, resulting in different symptoms [4]. Complex mechanisms such as inflammation, regional cell interaction, and GCase substrate preferences have also been proposed to explain the pathobiology of specific organ involvement and potentially the therapeutic efficacy [1]. The pathophysiological mechanisms of neurological involvement are still not well explained; the process of substrate accumulation in neurons is apparently low, and there is only significant accumulation when the residual GCase activity is extremely low, which happens in some types of GBA1 mutations [5]."

    "text": "GD is the most common lysosomal storage disease and is classified into three types, depending on the presence and rate of progression of neurologic manifestations [2,3]. The three types are genotypically and phenotypically diverse and differential diagnosis is challenging [6,7]. The most prevalent form of GD is type 1 (OMIM #230800), the non-neuronopathic form. The clinical manifestations are mainly in the hematopoietic system, skeletal system, and visceral organs. The other two types (2 and 3) have early involvement of the central nervous system, with different rates of neurological deterioration. Patients with GD type 2 (OMIM #230900) present with an acute neuronopathic form, with symptoms manifesting either prenatally or during infancy, ultimately resulting in death within the first two years of life. In contrast, GD type 3 (GD3, OMIM #231000) follows a more protracted course and is considered the subacute/chronic neuronopathic form. The incidence of GD3 in the general population is estimated to be less than 1 in 100,000 [8]. Based on the clinical manifestations, GD3 may be subdivided into three subtypes, characterized by predominant neurological involvement (GD3a), internal organ and skeletal involvement (GD3b), and aortic and cardiac valve calcifications (GD3c; cardiovascular type) [9,10]. However, the clinical manifestations often overlap, and this classification is underused in clinical practice. The phenotypic\u2013genotypic heterogeneity in the three types of Gaucher disease is well known; the only indicator that separates neurological from non-neurological forms is the presence of the p.Asn409Ser allele (formerly known as N370S), which excludes the diagnosis of type 2 or type 3 [11]."

In this regard, different dosages of enzyme replacement and chaperone treatments have been tested, but a consensus on the pharmacological treatment pathways is missing. An international registry of GD patients serves as a reference regarding patient characteristics, treatments, and outcomes [12]. Patients with GD often experience delays in diagnosis, frequent hospitalization and regular follow-up testing, complications of GD, and co-morbidities. Many GD patients all over the world have limited access to medical care and treatment due to their location or inability to pay [13,14]. However, given the particularity of GD3 and the differences in patient management protocols between different healthcare systems, country-specific studies on this population are required. This study aimed to report the characteristics of GD3 patients in Spain, including the genotype, phenotype, therapeutic options, and treatment responses."

GD3 was diagnosed early after onset, likely due to the prompt access of patients to the Spanish public healthcare system. However, other studies have reported the delayed diagnosis of GD patients due to different factors [27,28]. Among these factors, the most relevant are the rarity of the disease and its presentation, with non-specific symptoms overlapping with those of more common diseases in childhood, such as hematologic malignancy and infectious diseases [6]. Additionally, disseminating knowledge about GD3 to other healthcare professionals is crucial, given that neuropediatricians, ophthalmologists, orthopedic/traumatologists, and hematologists may be the first to care for these patients."

    "text": "The clinical heterogeneity of GD3, with no specific clinical signs/symptoms and wide clinical manifestation variation, poses challenges in recognizing the disease, especially in its later forms, and distinguishing between different phenotypes [28]. Notably, discriminating between GD1 and late GD3 or between late GD2 and early GD3 is not straightforward [2,29,30]. To address these challenges, diagnostic algorithms may improve the early diagnosis of patients with GD3, enabling the initiation of targeted treatments as early as possible [7,31,32]. Currently, there are several diagnostic algorithms available for GD that are based on the assessment of clinical symptoms, laboratory analysis, and genetic evaluation [31]. These algorithms have proven useful in identifying patients with GD, and some studies have suggested that they may improve the rate of diagnosis [7,33]. However, it is important to keep in mind that GD is a rare and complex disease, and early and accurate identification may be difficult given the variability of symptoms and lack of disease awareness among physicians and other healthcare professionals. Therefore, while diagnostic algorithms can be helpful in increasing the rate of diagnosis or shortening the delay in diagnosis, it is also important for physicians to have a thorough understanding of the disease and to be alert to possible symptoms in at-risk patients. To this end, monitoring neurological signs and symptoms during childhood is imperative for all types of GD. Neurodiagnostic techniques, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electrophysiology, reveal alterations that are secondary to advanced neurological damage but are not useful in making a differential diagnosis at the early disease stages [34]. In this regard, a genetic diagnosis is helpful, as some genotypes are more commonly associated with a particular clinical form [8]. However, patients with the same genotype, including siblings and identical twins, such as some of the patients in this series, may have different clinical presentations and outcomes due to various factors [35,36]."

However, other peripheral manifestations, such as those described within the D409H (c.1342G>C) genotype in homozygosis (cardiovascular calcifications or corneal opacities), appeared during follow-up. These manifestations progressed and had an unclear relationship with the treatment administered, as previously reported by Kurolap et al. [37]. Bone involvement was mild in GD3 patients, unlike the GD1 phenotype, which classically presents severe pain crisis at diagnosis. Regarding kyphosis, it had severe progression in our study and apparently was not related to the ERT, leading to impaired pulmonary capacity secondary to the important restriction; thus, many authors consider kyphosis one of the neurological manifestations in GD3 patients due to its severity and poor evolution [34] and one of the signs that can help to diagnose GD3 [38,39]. Moreover, this manifestation is associated with the Norrbottnian clinical variant of GD [33,39]. Growth retardation and microcephaly were also observed. In some cases, growth retardation may persist even after several years of treatment [30]. Long-term studies are needed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of bone therapy in patients with GD3. In summary, although some of the various organ manifestations of GD3 may be controlled with ERT, others may be progressive and severe."

As expected, psychomotor retardation symptoms worsened throughout the follow-up period. The involvement of extraocular muscles (EOM) was the most frequent neurological sign at diagnosis, in line with previous studies [12]. Although neurosensorial deafness, defined as abnormal BAEP, is not a common manifestation in the neuropathic forms of GD, it was frequent in our series. Sensorineural hearing loss in GD3 is attributed to a build-up of glucocerebroside in the nerve cells of the inner ear and in the auditory nerves that transmit auditory impulses to the brain [40,41]. Importantly, sensorineural deafness in GD3 may be progressive and, therefore, regular audiological assessments are essential to monitor hearing [41]."

Regarding the progression of symptoms, while hematological and visceral manifestations are common at the time of diagnosis, neurological abnormalities may appear within the first 1\u20132 years in most registries [12,42,43]. In summary, the classic phenotype of GD3 is characterized by a combination of neurological and visceral symptoms, the former being the most evident [31]. Patients may have wide variability in the severity and progression of symptoms, and the onset of symptoms may be in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. Neurological variability in GD3 is an important aspect as it can influence the course of the disease in individual patients, their prognosis, and their response to treatment [44]."

    "text": "Not surprisingly, two well-known variants associated with neurological symptoms in GD (c.1448T>C and c.1342G>C) constituted more than 70% of the disease-causing alleles (27/38). Of note, all the observed disease-causing alleles in our study were missense variants, except for one complete loss-of-function variant (c.1263_1317del55), which appeared in two siblings with a severe form [45]. This may be in accordance with one of the molecular models for neuronopathic GD, which posits that neurological symptoms arise from likely gain-of-function mechanisms caused by amino acid substitutions at critical glucocerebrosidase residues [46]. Previous studies have linked the [c.1448T>C]; [c.1448T>C] homozygous genotype to severe neurological symptoms in Japanese and Egyptian patients [30,47,48]. However, in our series of patients, this genotype, observed in 7/19 patients, was primarily associated with visceral manifestations such as hepato-splenomegaly and anemia/thrombocytopenia, with minimal neurological or ocular muscle involvement, with a median follow-up of 8 years. This raises the question of whether disease modification could be achieved through treatments during this time lag between visceral and neurological symptoms. The phenotype of the two [c.1342G>C]; [c.1342G>C] homozygotes is characterized by corneal opacities, hydrocephalus, valvular calcifications (aortic/mitral), and hepatosplenomegaly, but minimal or no primary hematologic or neurologic manifestations, and was first described in a Spanish family [49]. The prognosis of these patients seems determined by the cardiovascular involvement, which required valvular replacement in both patients. In contrast, c.1342G>C compound heterozygotes lack valvular calcifications or corneal opacities, with a phenotype likely determined by the clinical impact of the other allele [50]. Hence, we observed very severe neurologic involvement in the two [c.1483G>C] + [c.1497G>C] + [c.1263_1317del55] + [c.1342G>C] compound heterozygotes, which led to early deaths. Conversely, the only [c.1448T>C]; [c.1342G>C] compound heterozygote had a milder neurological phenotype and more hematologic and skeletal involvement. Interestingly, the genotype [c.475C>T]; [c.680A>G] was associated with a peculiar phenotype of organomegaly and persistent absent seizure, with good control with chaperone (ambroxol) treatment. Despite efforts to unify the criteria for the clinical and prognostic evaluation of patients with neuropathic forms of GD, phenotype\u2013genotype correlation is still considerably heterogeneous [1]. Indeed, the better genetic characterization of patients, including at least a complete analysis of the GBA1-GBAP1 locus at chromosome 1 and screening for variants at genes encoding proteins that modify glucocerebroside activity, such as PSAP and GRN, should help to establish better correlations in the future in these patients [50,51]."

However, it may reduce neuroinflammation by reducing the excessive microglial response to proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, although confirmatory studies are required [1]. As expected, hematological manifestations, organomegaly, and hepatic dysfunction responded very well to ERT in this series of GD3 patients [15,28,53,54]. However, ERT had no effect on the progression of severe kyphoscoliosis or interstitial pulmonary involvement. Other visceral manifestations that remained unmodified by treatment in our series were the valvular calcifications and corneal opacities detected in c.1342G>C homozygous patients. Moreover, patients with valvular calcifications required valve replacement techniques, and hydrocephalus required ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement."
