Type 1 is the most common and it is not associated with acute/subacute neurological damage, while types 2 and 3 are more severe, presenting with acute neuropathic and subacute neuropathic symptoms, respectively [6]. Type 1 GD represents 90-95% of all cases of GD and, although not life-threatening, it diminishes the quality of life and increases morbidity [6,7]. Although it is a panethnic disorder, type 1 GD is especially prevalent among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent [8]. In the last years, it has been reported that type 1 GD is associated with an increased risk of certain malignancies. Despite being considered a non-neuropathic type, in recent years, it has been recognized that type 1 GD may be associated with parkinsonism [9]."
