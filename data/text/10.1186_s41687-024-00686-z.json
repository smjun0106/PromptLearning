Patients with LOPD have decreased production of an enzyme, which leads to symptoms that gradually get worse, including muscle weakness and trouble breathing. Enzyme replacement therapy may slow down the disease progression. In recent years, enzyme replacement therapies have been improved. To measure the benefit of such new therapies, patients with LOPD are asked to fill in surveys about their symptoms before and during treatment, but there is no standard survey to use. In this study, we used a survey called the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) Physical Function short form 20a (PF20a) questionnaire. This questionnaire is used for various diseases and tests someone's ability to perform daily physical activities such as getting dressed. We compared the results of this survey to other tests which evaluate a variety of functions, such as how far a patient can walk in 6 minutes, leg muscle strength, and a patient's lung capacity. In general, we found that the score provided by the PROMIS PF20a questionnaire had moderate to strong agreement with other test scores. Furthermore, we looked at the minimum difference in PROMIS PF20a scores that a patient found a relevant difference (i.e., a relevant improvement or worsening of the disease). Patients found a difference between 2.4 and 4.2 points in the score relevant. The results from this study show that PROMIS PF20a may be used to measure symptoms and follow symptoms over time in patients with LOPD."

Avalglucosidase alfa received approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2021 [7] and cipaglucosidase alfa with miglustat received approval by the European Medicines Agency in 2023 [8]. These rhGAAs enhance mannose-6-phosphate receptor-mediated uptake of GAA, resulting in increased clearance of the accumulated glycogen in lysosomes.

In previous studies, some validation checks have been conducted to evaluate the use of R-PAct, PDIS, and PDSS in patients with LOPD [13, 14, 20]. In addition, Harfouche et al. evaluated the use of the PRO Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) in 30 patients with Pompe disease, concluding that selected PROMIS questionnaires are meaningful and address important concepts to patients with Pompe disease, including motor function and symptoms of functional disability [21]. However, this study had some limitations, including the low number of patients, open-label design with patients knowing what treatment they were receiving, and that PROMIS was measured at a single time point only. Subsequently, the PROMIS Physical Function short form 20a questionnaire (PROMIS PF20a) was included as a PRO instrument in the PROPEL phase 3 study, its patient-level data providing a key source of cross-sectional and longitudinal data to analyze the questionnaire in LOPD [6]. The PROMIS PF20a measures current self-reported capability of physical activities, including functioning of upper and lower extremities and central regions, and instrumental activities of daily living. It can be used in the adult general population and adults with chronic health conditions, in both clinical trials or clinical practice settings. The aim of this report is to show construct validity of PROMIS PF20a by comparing the scoring of this questionnaire in PROPEL to various tests for physical functioning as well as the R-PAct scale, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, to further validate its use in LOPD. A further aim was to improve interpretation of the PROMIS PF20a score in patients with LOPD by determining the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of PROMIS PF20a scores."

The questionnaire is available for public viewing [22] and has been used in patients with a high level of education and in patients with an education level below high school [40, 41]. PROMIS has created documentation explaining how to score the questionnaire and how to handle missing values. PROMIS works actively with communities to have its questionnaire translated in other languages than English, such as Spanish [41, 42]. Since the short form only contains 20 questions with 5 answering options, the time to complete this questionnaire is reasonable and comparable to R-PAct (18 questions with 3 answering options) [13], PDSS (12 questions that are answered on a scale from 0 [none] to 10 [as bad as I can imagine]), and PDIS (15 questions on mobilityrelated physical activities and mood in the past 24 h, with scales varying from 0 to 3 to 0 to 10) [20, 43]."

Future studies are needed to compare PROMIS PF20a to other PRO measurement tools such as R-PAct, PDIS, and PDSS. A strength of PROMIS PF20a compared to these other tools is that PROMIS PF20a is already used in other diseases, and that the score can be computed to a T-score metric, where 50 represents the average score for the general population in the United States and 10 is one standard deviation [44]. This allows comparison of the physical function of a patient with LOPD with the average general population and patients with other diseases."

    "text": "The PROPEL study was not designed to validate PROMIS PF20a, and therefore, the analyses presented in this manuscript should be regarded as secondary, exploratory analyses. However, the advantage of using PROPEL data was that we were able to evaluate PROMIS PF20a in a reasonably-sized cohort, considering the rarity of LOPD. Another limitation of the analyses is that follow-up scores of PRO measurement tools such as PROMIS PF20a are inevitably associated with baseline scores: a greater level of disability at baseline provides more opportunity for improvement than for deterioration. In our analysis, this seems quite balanced as the MCID for improvement (2.4) was relatively similar to the MCID for worsening (3.4)."

    "text": "Potential limitations of the use of MCIDs have been described in detail by Copay et al. [45]. A limitation of using SGIC overall well-being as an anchor is that recall bias may have occurred when patients recalled their health state of a year ago [46, 47]. SGIC is, nevertheless, considered a useful anchor in general as it directly asks patients whether they had observed a meaningful improvement (or worsening) as compared to baseline; in our study, it is important to note that SGIC is significantly, but only weakly correlated with PROMIS PF20a change from baseline at week 52. Moreover, the distribution-based MCIDs in general are not theoretically or empirically tied to any patient-reported experience. Hence MCIDs\u2013 whether anchor or distribution-basedin this study are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and should be interpreted cautiously."

The MCID ranged between 2.2 and 4.2 using different methodological approaches. These results and previously published data on PROMIS PF20a indicate that the questionnaire has validity and is a valuable, easy-to-use and readily available tool to measure physical function in patients with LOPD. Its use should be considered in future clinical studies of patients with LOPD and potentially in clinical practice."
