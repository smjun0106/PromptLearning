    "text": "Pompe disease (OMIM 232300, glycogen storage disease II) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by deficiency of acid a-glucosidase (GAA), an enzyme required for the breakdown of lysosomal glycogen (1). Based on the age of symptom onset and presence or absence of cardiomyopathy, Pompe disease is classified into two major subtypes, infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) and late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD). Patients with IOPD have minimal to no residual enzyme activity, which results in very early and rapid glycogen accumulation in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle. This glycogen accumulation leads to hypotonia, cardiomyopathy, and respiratory failure within days to weeks after birth, progressing to death by two years of age (2). In contrast, patients with LOPD have slower disease progression and may present from the first year to the sixth decade of life (3, 4)."

The availability of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with rhGAA has increased the life span and improved the quality of life for patients with IOPD (5, 6). While such improvements have benefited patients with Pompe disease overall, there is marked individual variability in treatment response to ERT and identifying patients who are likely to have a poor response to ERT remains a challenge. The response to ERT can be influenced by various factors such as age at initiation of ERT, angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) genotype, extent of preexisting pathology, cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM) status, and, critically, the development of anti-rhGAA IgG antibodies (7\u201311)."

CRIM status (positive or negative) is defined as the presence or absence of GAA protein expressed by the patient (13). CRIM-negative IOPD patients have two severe GAA variants and do not make any native GAA enzyme, leaving them prone to development of anti-drug antibodies to ERT due to their lack of natural immune tolerance, as GAA would normally be treated by the immune system as a self-antigen. As such, their immune systems recognize rhGAA as fully foreign, leading to development of HSAT against ERT. In contrast, CRIM-positive IOPD patients express some residual GAA enzyme that allows for generation of natural immune tolerance to some extent."

    "text": "To minimize the deleterious effects of anti-rhGAA IgG antibodies, various immune modulation strategies have been tried over the years. Among these approaches, a protocol of immune tolerance induction (ITI) with a short-course of rituximab, methotrexate, and IVIG has proven to be the most effective when initiated in ERT-naïve settings, and this has become a standard of care in CRIM-negative IOPD patients to block adaptive immune responses (14, 15). Widespread use of this ITI protocol, especially in high-risk CRIM-negative IOPD patients, has led to increased survival. While CRIM-negative status is a clear risk factor for HSAT and an indicator for ITI therapy, CRIM-positive status is not always predictive of a low anti-rhGAA IgG antibody response as approximately 32% of patients with CRIM-positive IOPD, and a subset of LOPD, patients develop HSAT resulting in a poor clinical response to treatment (10). This highlights the significant need for an immune biomarker or signature that could identify high-risk CRIM-positive patients at diagnosis before starting ERT and/or identify signs of sensitization during the course of therapy. Development of such a screening and monitoring tool is currently hampered by our limited understanding of the immunobiology that leads to HSAT against ERT in Pompe disease."

Development of a specific, sustained antibody response requires not only the primary activation of B cells but also the contribution of T cell help via cell-cell interactions and secreted cytokines to generate mature memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells capable of secreting high-titer specific antibodies. We designed our experiments not only to focus on the elements of this adaptive immune response but also to detect signs of underlying inflammation that could contribute to overall immune activation and thereby exacerbate adaptive responses. The immunophenotyping data were analyzed to identify any unique immunological characteristics associated with the HSAT response. In this hypothesis-generating pilot study, we aimed to: (1) provide insights into the basic mechanisms leading to immune sensitization against ERT, which could further guide the evolution of immunotherapy strategies; (2) to understand the impact of currently used ITI regimens on immune phenotypes in IOPD, and also (3) to ultimately guide the development of biomarkers and/or disease risk signatures for HSAT."

Patients were divided into three groups based on antibody titers and ITI treatment status: (a) Group 1 (LT; n=20), long-term IOPD survivors who did not receive ITI and maintained low antibody titers, (b) Group 2 (ITI+LT; n=10), long-term high-risk IOPD survivors who received ITI with rituximab, methotrexate +/- IVIG in the ERT-naïve setting and maintained low antibody titers, and (c) Group 3 (HSAT; n=10), IOPD patients who developed and maintained anti-rhGAA IgG antibody titers of ≥12,800 (including a mix of patients who received ITI and those who did not). Group 2 included CRIM-negative patients as well as CRIM-positive patients that were identified as high-risk based on family history or a combination of GAA variants that were previously seen in CRIM-positive patients with high antibody titers. The time that patients had been receiving ERT at the time of sample acquisition is closely correlated with age, and is included in Table 1, and a graph representing the close correlation (Spearman's r = 0.9773, P<0.0001) is included in the Supplementary Figures."

In the first, broader comparison, all patients with HSAT (Group 3, n=10) were compared with all patients with LT (Group 1 combined with Group 2, n=30). This approach (LT vs. HSAT; Group 1 + 2 vs. Group 3) includes a greater number of patients (n=40) with a range of disease severity and effects, but also a significant range of ages, especially in Group 1 (Tables 1, 2). With the goal of narrowing the analysis to optimally matched groups for comparison, we also carried out a focused sub-group analysis of only LT patients who have been treated with ITI (Group 2) compared to HSAT patients (Group 3). An additional feature of this sub-analysis is that it compares two groups that are more similar in age [Group 2 age 36.58 +/- 13.72 months vs. Group 3 age 34.24 +/- 35.87 months (mean +/- SD)]. This is significant especially considering the unique features of immune phenotype and function in early childhood compared to that of older children and adults (16, 17). Patients in Groups 2 and 3 are all considered high-risk due to the CRIM-negative status and/or the expected severity of their identified variants. For each variable studied, regression analysis was carried out controlling for age at the time of sampling to identify parameters that were significantly different between groups."

To determine whether the composition ofcirculating B cells reflects evidence of such a response, we analyzed the percentage of various maturational states of B cells in PBMCs, including transitional B cells (most nascent B cells in transit from bone marrow (BM) to periphery; CD19+CD20+CD38++CD24++), naïve B cells (antigen-specific but not activated; CD19+IgD+CD27-), unswitched memory B cells (previously activated in response to antigen but have not undergone a GC reaction and IgG heavy chain class-switching \u2013 argued to be the circulating equivalent of splenic marginal zone B cells; CD19+IgD+CD27+), switched memory (previously activated in response to antigen and matured by undergoing IgG heavy chain class-switching; CD19+IgD-CD27+), and plasmablasts (nascent antibody secreting cells typically in transit from the periphery to bone marrow; CD19+CD27+IgD-CD20-CD38++) (Figures 4A\u2013E; gating scheme in Supplementary Figure 1) (20\u201323).

In the focused analysis comparing only LT patients who were treated with ITI (Group 2) vs. HSAT patients (Group 3), there was again a significant decrease in unswitched memory cells in the HSAT group (0.57% vs. 1.36% of CD19+ B cells; Padj=0.008) (Figure 4C).

Further, we confirmed that patients with HSAT tend to cluster according to their low GM-CSF and high CXCL11 levels (Figure 5C), though there is a significant overlap between groups. Thus, most patients with HSAT have a low ratio of GM-CSF/CXCL11 (below 2), but not all patients with a low GM-CSF/CXCL11 ratio have elevated Ab titers (Figure 5D)."

Given that multiple, diverse parameters were identified as being associated with development of HSAT in patients with IOPD, we set out to integrate these parameters into a potential immunophenotypic signature profile of patients who were in the HSAT group. We carried out principal component analysis (PCA) utilizing the measured values of parameters that were identified as significantly different in HSAT patients (listed in Figure 6A). Principal component 1 (PC1) accounted for 23.6% of variance in the data set, and patients from the cohort tend to segregate along PC1 according to their HSAT status, with Group 3 having more negative values in PC1, while LT groups centered more in the positive range of PC1 (Figure 6B and Supplementary Figure 8B). Patients that were more than 90 weeks old at the time of sampling were mostly in Group 1 and generally segregated according to positive values along PC2 (Figure 6B, Supplementary Figure 8B). Thus, patients tend to be distributed according to HSAT status along PC1. The PC1 loading values for each HSAT-signature immunophenotype parameter (e.g., GM-CSF concentration or % CD3+ T cells) were used to weight the z-standardized values of that parameter (Figure 6A, Supplementary Figure 8A), and the sum of the weighted values was taken to generate a standardized, PC1-weighted HSAT Signature Score, which was then calculated for everyone in the cohort. The HSAT signature scores were plotted by group (Figure 6C), and patients in Group 3 scored lower than patients in Groups 1 and 2, with minimal overlap between LT groups (Groups 1 and 2) and Group 3. Finally, antibody titers were compared to HSAT signature scores, demonstrating that elevated antibody titers correlated with low signature scores across the whole cohort (Figure 6D)."

This highlights an important consideration in interpreting the results of this comparison; the differences observed may not only reflect the use of ITI, but also the underlying immunological state associated with the factors which put these patients at increased risk for HSAT (i.e., CRIM-negative, high-risk mutations), and which lead to the administration of ITI."

Two decades later, however, we continue to have a limited understanding of cellular and cytokine mediators that govern immune responses during treatment with enzyme replacement. To counteract the anti-rhGAA IgG antibody response, various immunomodulation approaches have been employed with varying degrees of success, and our approach has been to use a combination of a short course of rituximab, methotrexate, and IVIG. Since both B and T cells participate in germinal center responses that result in sustained high-titer antibodies, both B cell-targeting (rituximab) and T cell targeting (methotrexate) agents were incorporated into the regimen. While we have been able to demonstrate normalization of CD19+ B cells to baseline levels after depletion with rituximab, very little else is known about the immunological state of patients with IOPD, especially those who received ITI and those who develop HSAT. To address this gap in current knowledge, we conducted a pilot study to establish an immune profile of the cellular subsets and secreted cytokines in a cohort of IOPD patients treated with ERT with or without ITI."

For example, high blood levels of a particular cell may correlate either positively or negatively with levels in tissue. Much as road traffic is lower during work hours when people are generally gathered at workplaces rather than in transit, tissue sequestration of a particular cell type into a site of active immune reaction may result in a relative decrease in the circulating frequency of that cell. With blood immune phenotyping, we capture a snapshot of cell populations in transit between compartments at one point in time. As such, an understanding of established relevant immunological paradigms must be cautiously employed when inferring mechanisms from circulating cell populations and cytokine levels. Another important distinction to make is between cell frequency, which we report here, and absolute cell counts. While the frequency ofa cell conveys the fractional representation ofthat cell type within a parent population, it often does not correlate directly with the absolute cell count, which is the number ofcells per volume of blood. These two measures can have different biological and diagnostic values but must not be confused or considered equivalent."

    "text": "CRIM status has been an important tool for stratifying risk in IOPD patients, but alone it is not adequate to identify the risk of HSAT, as a significant number of CRIM-positive patients will go on to develop HSAT. The overall goal of this work was to conduct comprehensive immune profiling of cytokines and cell subsets to identify unique immunological features in patients who develop HSAT. These features may potentially serve as biomarkers representing a disease 'signature', which may in the future be refined and tested to identify patients at risk for developing HSAT. To that end, we conducted statistical analysis to compare age-adjusted group mean values for each parameter between IOPD patients on ERT who developed HSAT (Group 3) and all patients who did not (Group 1 + 2). We further compared only LT patients who received ITI (Group 2) with HSAT patients (Group 3), finding that most of the identified differences were consistent between these analyses. Given that several parameters were identified as being significantly altered in HSAT patients, we sought to integrate these measurements to account for their contribution to development of HSAT. We included all significantly different parameters in PCA, revealing that patients were distributed along PC1 according to their antibody titers and therefore their HSAT status. Given the small number of parameters included and the natural degree of variability found in human phenotyping data, HSAT patients did not form a purely discrete cluster but were clearly skewed toward the more negative values of PC1. Loading values in PC1, which roughly represent the degree to which a particular parameter (e.g., % CD3+ T cells) contributes to the difference between HSAT and LT patients, were used to weight the measured values for each parameter and all weighted values were combined to derive a single numerical HSAT Signature Score. When patients in the cohort were scored according to this method, there was a clear separation between patients with HSAT and those without. While these data and analyses provide confirmatory evidence that the variables identified are associated with the presence of HSAT in this cohort, it is important to recognize that the interpretation of these results and their significance should be limited to this study and this cohort at this time. True evaluation of such a signature score requires a test for validation in a separate and independent cohort, but the results ofthe current pilot study could be used to rationally guide such endeavors."

    "text": "While antibodies can be generated without help from T cells (i.e. T-independent) or in a T cell-dependent manner that doesn't involve maturation in a germinal center (GC), such antibody responses are typically short-lived and self-limited and lead to the production of lower titer and lower avidity antibody (16). Development of a highly specific, robust, and sustained antibody response such as HSAT against rhGAA involves the recruitment of B cells into GCs, where interactions with Tfh cells promote antibody affinity maturation, isotype class switching (i.e., from IgM and IgD to IgG, IgA, or IgE) (17, 18), and development of long-lived memory and antibody-secreting plasma cells. We observed a relative expansion of total B cells in the circulation of patients with HSAT that is accompanied by a shift in the circulating B cell population away from unswitched memory (CD27+IgD+) B cells. That this occurs in concert with high-titer specific IgG production suggests that the whole-body B cell compartment may be shifted toward a more mature type of memory and antibody-secretion response. While we did not detect a statistically significant difference in mature memory B or Tfh cells using robust testing methods, there is a clear visual decrease in the population of circulating mature memory B and Tfh cells in HSAT patients (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 2). This may reflect recruitment and/or sequestration of Tfh cells out of the circulation into the secondary lymphoid tissues where they can participate in GC responses. This may also help to explain the observed HSAT-associated decrease in circulating unswitched memory cells since it could reflect a dominant shift toward GCassociated B cell reactions that are committed to generating mature, tissue-associated memory and antibody secreting cells (i.e., plasma cells). This is further supported by our observation that anti-rhGAA antibody titers are positively correlated with mature memory B cells and plasmablasts, and negatively correlated with naïve and unswitched memory B cells."

    "text": "While Tfh cells play a key role in driving GC reactions that are essential for mature, robust, prolonged antibody responses, extrafollicular Th2 cells can also contribute to such antibody responses (16, 19). IL-4 and IL-13, which are secreted by Th2, Tfh, and several innate-type cells, are typically associated with atopic disease as well as immunity against extracellular parasites (e.g., helminths), but they also play an important broader role in humoral immunity. These cytokines not only drive B cell switching to IgG1 and IgE isotypes, but also act on B cells to support GC formation in type-2 immune responses, promote B cell proliferation, and protect them from apoptosis by modulating glycolytic metabolism (20, 21). Thus, IL-4/IL-13-deficient mice have decreased GC B cells during type-2 responses, and IL-4 from Th2 cells was sufficient to restore GC formation by acting directly on B cells (19). In the GAA−/− 129SVE mouse model of Pompe Disease, robust IgG1 antibody generation against human rhGAA is driven by immunodominant CD4+ Th2 cell epitopes, and these affected mice with high IgG antibody titers ultimately die from IgE-mediated anaphylaxis (22, 23). Our analysis demonstrated that the concentrations of type 2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) were significantly correlated with the increased percentage of Th2 cells in patients with HSAT. Since type 2 cytokines signal in a positive feedback loop to support ongoing Th2 cell differentiation and function, the correlation between type 2 cytokines and Th2 cells may reflect an expansion of cells in response to increased cytokine stimulation and/or increased secretion of cytokines by the expanded Th2 cell population. If activated Th2 cells contribute toward HSAT formation in humans, as they do in mice, an important question remains as to what mechanisms lead to their generation. A proposed summary model of how a dominant shift toward type 2 immunity in HSAT patients could feasibly contribute to the pathogenesis of HSAT is depicted in Supplementary Figure 11."

They lack endogenous expression of GAA, which normally drives the acquisition of immune tolerance through deletion of autoreactive T and B cell clones, and they undergo repeated administration of a specific antigenic stimulus (i.e., ERT with rhGAA). A quandary arises, therefore, in considering that patients in Group 2 who have the same immunological setup do not develop HSAT. The tolerizing regimens given to these patients due to their high-risk status allow them to maintain immune quiescence and avoid deleterious antibody responses through mechanisms of peripheral immune tolerance (e.g., influence of regulatory cells or tolerization of T or B cells through apoptosis or anergy). Conversely, some CRIM-positive patients do develop HSAT despite expressing endogenous GAA that should theoretically lead to natural immune tolerance. It is clear, therefore, that additional immunological and physiological factors are crucial for 'tipping the scale' from tolerance toward immunogenicity in HSAT patients. By examining parameters in our studies that define the immune profile of patients with HSAT (Group 3), we hope to gain insight into what factor(s) are responsible for this shift."

GM-CSF is a hematopoietic growth and differentiation factor for granulocytes and myeloid cells (e.g., monocytes and DCs), but it also plays an important part in myeloid cell activation, while CXCL11 is a chemokine originally described for its chemotactic properties, but which also has potent effects on immune cell signaling and differentiation (24\u201329). While high GM-CSF levels are strongly associated with disease in Multiple Sclerosis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and other inflammatory diseases, decreased plasma GM-CSF is not commonly reported to be associated with disease states (25, 26, 28). There is, however, a clear association in Crohn's Disease between decreased GM-CSF bioactivity and worsened disease severity (24, 28). Low GM-CSF in these patients has been linked to accelerated progression and increased gut permeability with resulting microbial translocation. In clinical trials, administration of recombinant GM-CSF to patients with moderate to severe Crohn's was associated with increased rates of disease remission (28, 30). Furthermore, GM-CSF-null mice have impaired gut barrier function and are prone to intestinal damage in models of murine ileitis (31, 32), while administration of exogenous GM-CSF ameliorates colitis in these models and promotes healing of the mucosal epithelial barrier (33, 34), further highlighting the importance of normal GM-CSF function for maintaining intestinal barrier integrity. In addition to its role in mucosal healing and barrier integrity, GM-CSF may also play a role in maintaining a healthy intestinal microbiome (35)."

GM-CSF and CXCL11 are functionally related such that experimental antibody-mediated blockade of GM-CSF drives human monocytes to differentiate into CXCL11-producing immunomodulatory cells (24). CXCL11, in turn, was reported to inhibit T cell proliferation (24). The diminished levels of GM-CSF observed in patients with HSAT may therefore not only contribute to the increased levels of CXCL11 production in these patients but also to their decreased frequency of T cells due to the anti-proliferative influence of CXCL11 on these cells. CXCL11 both supports Th2 differentiation and inhibits Th17 differentiation in vitro, and administration of stabilized CXCL11-Ig fusion protein to mice resulted in decreased central nervous system Th1 and Th17 cells and increased Th2 and regulatory Tr1 cells in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (36, 37). CXCL11 also promotes susceptibility to cutaneous leishmaniasis in mice by promoting Th2 and inhibiting Th1 responses (38). These findings described in mice suggest that elevated levels of CXCL11 observed in HSAT patients may support the expansion of Th2 cells, promoting a dominant Type 2 milieu, and contributing to a paucity of Th17 cells."

In our theoretical model (Supplementary Figure 10), decreased plasma GM-CSF results in secretion of CXCL11 (24) which then acts on T cells to promote Th2 differentiation, inhibit Th17 differentiation, and decrease T cell proliferation, resulting in overall lower T cells with a Th2 predominance. The presence of increased T cell activation markers in HSAT patients suggests the influence of a broadly activating stimulus. We suggest that this chronic immune activation may be the result of microbial translocation due to impaired gut barrier integrity resulting from low GM-CSF concentrations. Decreased levels of Th17 cells, which we also observed in HSAT patients, could also contribute to microbial translocation since IL-17 is strongly associated with normal gut barrier integrity (42, 43). Both GM-CSF and IL-17A have been shown to promote colonic epithelial barrier integrity by enhancing expression and/or regulating protein trafficking of tight-junction proteins (44\u201346)."

Given our findings, we suggest the possibility that these GI symptoms may in part be related to the immunological state of some IOPD patients, and specifically to low GM-CSF and/or Th17 levels. Low GM-CSF bioactivity due to anti-GM-CSF antibodies in Crohn's Disease is associated with increased gut barrier permeability, microbial translocation, and innate immune activation (48), and it is now accepted that a large number of diverse pathological states are associated with altered gut barrier integrity (49). There is currently no direct evidence for increased gut permeability in IOPD, but it has not been specifically tested. Activation of innate immune cells in the gut by microbial products stimulating TLRs would result in the release of inflammatory mediators that then cause bystander immune activation of T and B cells. Several aspects of this model could be readily tested, especially it's more speculative aspect: increased gut permeability and chronic immune activation due to microbial translocation. Given that it is unlikely to be explained by simple mendelian variation, the cause of low GM-CSF in HSAT patients remains unclear."

While levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were not significantly different in HSAT patients, there were significant positive correlations between higher %Th2 cells and multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-a, MIP-1a, and MIP-1b. There were also obvious but non-statistically significant correlations between Th2 cells and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1b, CX3CL1, and IL-8 in HSAT patients. This may suggest that their increased risk for HSAT is associated with smoldering low-level inflammation due to either the primary impairment of glycogen handling and the resulting glycogen buildup, and/or low-level T and B cell activation in response to ongoing ERT exposure. Chronic gut leakiness would lead to chronic exposure to microbial products (e.g., LPS) that can cause innate immune activation. The resulting chronic inflammatory response, even at low levels, could play a role in secondary T and B cell activation, ultimately adding fuel to the fire of ongoing antibody responses. If chronic innate immune activation and inflammation are shown to contribute to HSAT responses (including breakthrough responses after ITI), it would suggest a role for therapeutic interventions that target the source of the inciting inflammatory triggers (e.g., gut leakiness resulting in LPS exposure) and/or the innate immune system's inflammatory response to these triggers."

The absence of differences in circulating Tregs does not, however, rule out this possibility. An expansion of rhGAA-specific Tregs at the time of ITI administration very likely would not be reflected in the frequency of overall circulating population, as such putative rhGAA-specific Tregs specific would carry out their suppressive function at the tissue level.

This is particularly true in the case of the PC1-weighted HSAT Signature Score we derived to integrate several HSAT-associated parameters. While the score appropriately stratifies the patients from which it is derived according to their antibody titers, validation requires studying these parameters and the HSAT Signature Score in an independent cohort. The available data on anti-rhGAA IgG antibody titers only detailed total antibodies and was unable to distinguish between neutralizing vs. binding (non-neutralizing) antibodies. In addition, prior data supports that the patients who develop high total IgG titers, even those with no abnormality noted in uptake or binding, showed suboptimal clinical response to ERT (5, 50). Additionally, the impact of anti-rhGAA IgG antibodies in patients with LOPD is not completely clear in contrast to the well-documented evidence on the deleterious effect in IOPD patients.

We report a reciprocal relationship between Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) and Th1 vs. Th2 cells. While it is well-recognized that Th1 and Th2 cells exert a reciprocal negative regulation on each other's development through cytokine signals, it must also be considered that the reciprocity of these correlations also likely arises from the gating scheme which parses Th1 and Th2 cells based on CXCR3 positivity, and therefore does reveal an overall literal shift in the effector population toward Th2 cells based on surface phenotype. Finally, in our theoretical model, we propose a relationship between CXCL11 and T cell proliferation, enhanced Th2 differentiation, and impaired Th17 differentiation, but we did not see direct correlations between these measurements. This may be explained by the knowledge that most cytokines act most potently at the microscopic scale of cell-cell interactions, and plasma levels of cytokines may not always reflect these paracrine interactions.

Un d e rstand i ng the immunobiology in the new emerging phenotype of long-term CRIM-negative IOPD survivors could help identify the factors that may lead to their clinical decline. Among the phenotypic traits studied, signs of chronic inflammation and immune activation are emerging as likely candidates underlying such progressive disease. There are potential implications that may be drawn from the findings in this study which may impact therapeutic strategies for mitigation of HSAT. Given that both T and B cells seem to be significantly affected in patients that develop HSAT, the addition of intensified T-cell targeted therapies (e.g., cyclosporine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or mycophenolate mofetil) in addition to B-cell depletion with rituximab could more potently prevent the initial sensitization of T cells that go on to contribute to mature B memory cell and plasma cell responses. Given the vulnerable state of IOPD patients, the use of such agents would require careful consideration and may first be best evaluated in the rare patients who develop breakthrough HSAT after an initial round of ITI or in adults with Pompe disease. Furthermore, multiple lines of evidence presented here suggest a role for innate immune activation in driving the pathogenesis of HSAT. Biologic agents that block inflammatory cytokines and/or cytokine receptors (e.g., against IL-1b or TNF-a) may therefore have a therapeutic role in preventing or treating it. Recombinant preparations of GM-CSF have been widely used to support myeloid reconstitution after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, to treat neutropenia during chemotherapy, or to ameliorate radiation-induced myelosuppression (51, 52). If low GM-CSF is found to play a likely role in the pathogenesis of HSAT, these off-the-shelf medicines could therefore be further studied and, if successful, incorporated into clinical trials."
