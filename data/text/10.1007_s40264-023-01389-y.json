    "text": "Background To assess the causal relationship between a medicinal product and a reported event, relevant information needs to be present. Information elements for assessing cases of exposure to medicinal products during pregnancy were predefined and used in a new tool to assess the quality of information. However, the extent in which the presence or absence of these predefined information elements is associated with the overall clinical quality of these cases, as evaluated by pharmacovigilance experts, remains uncertain. Objective We aimed to validate a novel method to assess the clinical quality of information in real-world pregnancy pharmacovigilance case reports. Methods The clinical quality of case reports regarding medicinal product exposure and pregnancy-related outcomes was appraised from spontaneous reports, literature, Teratology Information Services (UK and Switzerland), The Dutch Pregnancy Drug Register, the Gilenya pregnancy registry and the Enhanced PV programme of Novartis. Assessment was done by means of the novel standardised tool based on the presence and relevance of information, and by expert judgement. The novel tool was validated compared to the expert assessment as the gold standard expressed as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves, after which the sensitivity and specificity were calculated using cross-tabulations. Inter-rater variability was determined by means of weighted Cohen's kappa. Results One hundred and eighty-six case reports were included. The clinical quality score as assessed by the novel method was divided into three categories with cut-off values of 45% (poor to intermediate) and 65% (intermediate to excellent). Sensitivity was 0.93 and 0.96 for poor to intermediate and intermediate to excellent, respectively. Specificity was respectively 0.52 and 0.73. Inter-rater variability was 0.65 (95% confidence interval 0.53\u20130.78) for the newly developed approach, and 0.40 (95% confidence interval 0.28\u20130.52) for the gold standard assessment. Conclusions The tool described in this study using the presence and relevance of elements of information is the first designed, validated and standardised method for the assessment of the quality of information of case reports in pregnancy pharmacovigilance data. This method confers less inter-rater variability compared with a quality assessment by experts of pregnancy-related pharmacovigilance data."

    "text": "As pregnant women are almost never included in clinical studies, the information regarding the safety of medicinal product exposure during pregnancy is mainly dependent on the reporting of experiences with exposure to these products in the real world. Several different data collection methods specifically aimed at the collection of safety information are currently in use to capture and analyse reports on risks associated with medicinal products used during pregnancy [1]. For example, individual case safety reports (ICSRs) are collected by national pharmacovigilance centres and marketing authorisation holders (MAHs), and then forwarded to the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization collaborating centre, the Uppsala Monitoring Centre [2, 3]. In the post-marketing phase, ICSRs can be reported spontaneously, solicited or based on cases published in the literature. Furthermore, Teratology Information Services (TIS), pregnancy registries or MAH-initiated enhanced pharmacovigilance programmes (in which spontaneously reported pregnancies are followed, using amongst others a structured follow-up data collection at set intervals) gather and analyse pregnancy data with the purpose of increasing the knowledge about the safety of medicinal product exposure during pregnancy [4\u20136]."

    "text": "A significant challenge in pharmacovigilance is to assess the likelihood that the medicinal product caused or contributed to the occurrence of the event experienced by the patient, i.e. causality assessment. In order to assess the possibility of a causal relationship between exposure to a medicinal product during pregnancy and an adverse pregnancy outcome, it is important that the underlying data (raw variables) and information (processing and interpretation of raw data), in individual case reports and case series, are both present and of high quality [7]. Therefore, in order to establish reliably whether there is a causal relationship between a medicinal product and a reported event, relevant information for the causality assessment needs to be present. A case report with many relevant elements of information containing the appropriate meaningful information is considered to have a high clinical quality of information. Whereas a report with only little information present that is relevant to assessing the causal relationship is considered to have a low clinical quality of information, even if other details not relevant to the particular event under assessment are well reported. Which information is relevant is dependent on the reported association of a medicinal product and a pregnancy-related outcome."

Unfortunately, these methods do not take the relevance of information into account and base their assessment only on completeness of certain variables. An exception is the instrument designed for the assessment of the clinical quality of the information, developed by Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb [8]. All aforementioned approaches were however not specifically designed for pregnancy data, which requires information that may differ substantially from the information needed for a non-pregnancy-related causality assessment. In the context of general pharmacovigilance, information concerning the suspected medicinal product, the event, the timing and alternative explanations is generally important. Additionally, in the context of pregnancy-related pharmacovigilance, information concerning both the mother and child needs to be taken into account, and the nature of the medicinal product\u2013event association may differ substantially for various clinical scenarios."

In this way, redundant information in the assessment will not result in an overestimation of the clinical quality. In the second step, all relevant information is assessed on its presence, consisting of both completeness and preciseness. This prevents the overestimation of the clinical quality due to irrelevant, ambiguous or unclear information. A characteristic of this tool is that the assessment of the clinical quality using this method requires expertise in the field of pregnancy pharmacovigilance.

Seven pregnancy pharmacovigilance data collection sources were selected, which include most of the available primary data sources for this purpose. For data sources that were believed to possibly differ between centres or study designs, such as TIS centres and pregnancy or drug registries, multiple centres or studies were included. The included clinical scenarios (pregnancy loss, congenital anomalies or chromosomal defects, foetal or neo-natal complications, infant or child complications, maternal pregnancy-related complications, and no adverse outcomes or complications) were based on the similarity between the profiles of information elements that are necessary for a risk assessment. This method was not validated for the assessment of the clinical quality of reports regarding, for example delivery complications, clinical scenarios related to paternal medicinal product exposure during the periconceptional period, clinical scenarios related to the use of medicinal products during breastfeeding, and maternal non-pregnancy-related complications. The latter scenario could be assessed using the instrument for the assessment of the clinical quality of information designed by Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb, which was not designed for pregnancy data specifically, while for the other three scenarios an adapted version of the method described in this study would have to be designed [8]. For the clinical scenarios related to paternal medicinal product exposure during the periconceptional period, the proportion of cases related to paternal exposure is rather low. Currently, the selection and assessment of cases of paternal exposure are complicated, as both maternal and paternal factors play a role. Developing an extensive list of additional elements related to paternal exposure would be necessary. For this reason, this category was not taken into account. Additionally, the scenario 'infant or child complications' was vastly under-represented in the current dataset (Table 2). This was owing to the fact that these events are often more difficult to capture because of a limited follow-up period."
