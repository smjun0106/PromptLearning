    "text": "models lacking the fly orthologue of GBA1 (Gba1b) have an altered gut microbiome, which triggers a widespread innate immune response. Accordingly, we show that removal of gut bacteria using antibiotics leads to a reduction in the immune response and health benefits. Stimulating innate immunity, specifically the NF-kB/IMD pathway, shortens the survival of Gba1b deficient flies, suggesting that the overactive immune system is toxic. Conversely, genetic removal of this branch of the immune response is harmful and associated with increased gut bacteria. Lastly, we identify widespread defects in a process called autophagy, which helps degrade and recycle cellular waste. Pharmacologically boosting autophagy extends survival and lowers the gut immune response without changing the gut bacteria. Taken together, our findings suggest that the gut microbiome and autophagy defects in Gba1b deficient flies trigger an abnormal immune response. Thus, drugs which alter the gut microbiome or stimulate autophagy may offer potential therapeutic benefits to patients with GBA1-associated disorders."

Bi-allelic mutations in the GBA1 gene are known to cause Gaucher disease (GD), whereas heterozygous mutations represent a major genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), conferring an approximately 20-fold increased risk [1, 2]. GD is a multi-systemic disorder characterised by the lysosomal accumulation of GluCer within macrophages of the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and other tissues, causing widespread organ dysfunction and inflammation [3]. PD is characterised neuropathologically by the presence of intraneuronal inclusions called Lewy bodies, composed predominantly of aggregated α-synuclein (αSyn), which forms higher-order aggregates in the presence of GluCer, leading to further lysosomal dysfunction [4]. Another pathological hallmark of PD is dopaminergic neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, where widespread GCase deficiency is also observed [5\u20137]."

Moreover, studies spanning clinical and basic science research have demonstrated both central and peripheral immune changes in PD and GD, implicating the immune system in gut-brain axis communication. Multiple genetic studies have linked PD risk to immune-related pathways and pathogenic variants in immune genes (e.g., Toll-like receptor (TLR-4), Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α and Human Leukocyte Antigen-DR (HLA-DR) [10\u201313]. Furthermore, impaired autophagy in macrophages derived from peripheral monocytes of GD patients leads to increased secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)6 and IL-β in association with inflammasome activation [14]. Despite the growing evidence linking immune dysfunction to sporadic PD and GD, the precise role of immune responses in gut-brain cross-talk in GBA1-PD and neuronopathic GD is yet to be elucidated."

Activation of innate immune pathways results in the up regulation of a cadre of structurally diverse antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with bactericidal properties. Nevertheless, chronic immune pathway activation is deleterious to health and thus activation of the innate immune pathways must be tightly regulated [17]. Autophagy is a biological process responsible for the removal of damaged organelles, aggregated proteins, lipids and PAMPs. During autophagy, the cellular material to be degraded is sequestered into double-membraned vesicles called autophagosomes. At a later stage, these structures fuse with lysosomes containing hydrolases, which degrade the sequestered cargo [18]."

Remarkably, we report that the intestinal microbiota is necessary for immune activation, and that eradication of the altered gut microbiome in Gba1b knockout flies improves lifespan, locomotor and inflammatory phenotypes. Moreover, we demonstrate that direct stimulation of autophagy with rapamycin is sufficient to reduce immune activation and to partially rescue the GCase-deficient lifespan phenotype. Lastly, we show that modulation of the NF-kB/IMD pathway, through overexpression and knockout of Relish (Rel), is detrimental to flies lacking Gba1b, suggesting that chronic manipulation of these pathways should be approached with caution in GBA1-related disease. Together, these results suggest that gut microbes play an important role in triggering the immune response in GBA1-associated disorders, and that targeting the gut microbiome or improving the autophagic clearance of PAMPs may represent a potential therapeutic strategy in these disorders."

Many of these significantly expressed genes are key components of the Toll, IMD and JAK-STAT innate immune pathways (S1 Fig). We used quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to independently examine innate immune gene expression. The AMP Drosomycin (Drs), a reporter gene of the Toll pathway, was significantly up-regulated in the heads of 3-week-old Gba1b-/- flies compared to controls (Fig 1C). Similar changes were seen in the expression levels of Diptericin A (DptA), an AMP downstream of the IMD pathway and TotA, a reporter gene of the JAK-STAT pathway (Fig 1C).

This was corroborated by the co-expression of an IMD reporter construct, DptA-LacZ. This revealed strong diffuse LacZ staining in the fat body tissue of flies lacking Gba1b, consistent with IMD pathway activation (Fig 2E). An increase in innate immune signalling in the intestinal tissue was also observed. Drs and DptA gene expression were significantly elevated in the midgut tissue of Gba1b-/- flies compared to controls (Fig 2F).

Changes in intestinal function were identified by analysing the rate of faeces production following the feeding of food supplemented with 0.5% bromophenol blue (BPB). Aged Gba1b-/- flies exhibited a delay in intestinal transit time, with significantly fewer faecal deposits produced in the first few hours after consuming BPB food compared to controls (Fig 3A). We also noted that the faecal content of control flies was more concentrated, with a high proportion of oblong shaped ROD deposits compared to non-ROD circular faecal deposits, whilst Gba1b-/- flies almost exclusively produced non-ROD deposits (Fig 3A). The latter represent faeces with a higher water content [29]. Taken together, our results show delayed intestinal emptying and altered faecal content in Gba1b-/- flies, in keeping with the gastrointestinal dysfunction seen in PD. The altered intestinal transit was not due to reduced feeding, as a CAFE assay revealed no significant difference in food consumption between aged Gba1b-/- flies and age-matched control flies (S5B Fig)."

    "text": "In addition to GI dysfunction, compromised intestinal barrier integrity has also been reported in PD patients [30] [31]. We therefore employed a Smurf assay to assess gut permeability in Gba1b-/- flies. This involved feeding with a non-absorbable blue food dye [32], and measuring the proportion of flies that display the presence of the blue dye outside of the gut, resulting in a blue Smurf appearance. Smurf flies were more abundant in the aged Gba1b-/population relative to age-matched controls, demonstrating compromised gut barrier integrity (Fig 3B). In addition to GI pathophysiological defects in PD patients, changes in the gut microbiome have been described as a precursor to neuropathology [33\u201335]. In view of the intestinal immune activation and gut dysfunction in Gba1b-/- flies, we performed qPCR analysis using 16S universal primers and bacterial culture on midgut tissue from aged Gba1b-/- flies and controls to assess microbial load. A significant increase in overall bacterial load by qPCR was observed in midguts from Gba1b-/- flies compared to control flies (Fig 3C). This was supported by an increase in colony forming units (CFUs) in cultured gut extracts (Fig 3D). In addition, 16S ribosomal RNA-sequencing demonstrated clear differences in the intestinal microbes of Gba1b-/- flies compared to control flies (S5A Fig). In particular, there was a significant increase in the Acetobacter and Lactobacillus genera in the gut of Gba1b-/- flies."

    "text": "Since Gba1b-/- flies exhibit an increased bacterial load of altered composition, we determined if a bacterial challenge was a contributor to early mortality in Gba1b-/- flies. We orally challenged Gba1b-/- flies with the commensal bacteria Lactobacillus plantarum cultured from colonies isolated from control gut microbiota. Infected Gba1b-/- flies displayed significantly greater mortality than control flies at day 3 post-infection (Fig 3E). Quantitative CFU assessment showed that there were no significant differences in the Lactobacillus plantarum gut load between Gba1b-/- flies and controls after oral infection (S5C Fig). To further understand if the early mortality was due to bacterial proliferation or an overactivation of the innate immune response in the mutant flies, we determined the levels of Drs following an intrathoracic injection with the heat-killed bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. Aged Gba1b-/- flies exhibited a ~3-fold change in Drs production compared to controls at 96 hours post injection (S5D Fig). Furthermore, intrathoracic injection with heat-killed S. aureus resulted in a reduction in the lifespan of Gba1b-/- flies compared to flies injected with PBS vehicle alone (S5E Fig). The lifespan of control flies injected with heat-killed bacteria was not significantly different to that of PBS injected flies (S5E Fig). This suggests that it is the inflammatory stimulus and its uncontrolled immune response, rather than bacterial proliferation, that results in compromised survival in Gba1b-/- flies. Together our data suggest that Gba1b-/- flies are unable to effectively regulate and respond to commensal gut microbiota, contributing to adverse health outcomes."

Raising Gba1b-/- flies under GF conditions resulted in a significant reduction of DptA expression as well lifespan extension (Fig 4B and 4C). These survival benefits appeared to be specific to Gba1b-/- flies, as GF control flies did not exhibit improved lifespan compared with non-GF controls.

In addition to the increased microbial load, significantly higher levels of TotA were detected in Gba1b-/-, RelE20 flies (Fig 6D), suggesting an enhanced activation of the JAK/STAT damage response pathway. These results led us to hypothesise that an elevated bacterial count in the gut might induce damage and increased turnover of the intestinal epithelium.

In agreement with the effect on lifespan, we found that GF Gba1b-/- flies treated with rapamycin had similar levels of DptA when compared with non-GF Gba1b-/- rapamycin treated flies (Fig 8D).

For that purpose, we fed flies with chloroquine (CQ), a well-characterized autophagy inhibitor that blocks autolysosome fusion [46], and then measured the effect on the autophagic and immune pathways. Feeding flies with CQ resulted in accumulation of Atg8a-II and Ref(2)P (Fig 8E) and significantly increased DptA expression in the gut tissue (Fig 8F). Overall, these data suggest that basal autophagy is intricately involved in the control of the innate immune response, and that blockage of autophagy in the gut is sufficient to recapitulate the immune phenotypes observed in Gba1b-/- fly guts."

Our results thus confirm that complete loss of Gba1b gene activity is associated with strong innate immune activation, including the JAK-STAT stress response.

Further probing revealed increased innate immune activation, predominantly of the IMD and Toll pathways, in the intestinal tissue of Gba1b-/- flies. It is likely that these gut pathologies are a consequence of GCase loss-of-function in the intestinal tissue, as we confirmed Gba1b gene expression in the Drosophila gut. Importantly, our findings reflect those seen in PD patients where enteric inflammation on colonic biopsies has been reported, including increased intestinal expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL6 and IL-1β, and the bacterial endotoxin ligand TLR4 [28, 58].

Consistent with the intestinal microbiome playing a role in GBA1-associated neurodegeneration, we observed increased intestinal bacterial load and alterations in the composition of the gut microbiome in Gba1b-/- flies. There was a significant increase in the abundance of Acetobacter and Lactobacillus, the commonest genera in the fly gut [62].

Our results also mirror several studies reporting changes in several gut bacterial species between PD patients and control groups [35, 65, 66]. The chronic gut immune activation observed in Gba1b-/- flies likely promotes further microbiome dysbiosis, which in turn can lead to impairment of gut function and ultimately reduced survival [67]. Support for intestinal microbiome-mediated effects on the CNS in Gba1-/-flies, i.e., via gut-brain axis communication, was achieved by raising mutant and control flies under GF conditions. Modulation of the intestinal microbiome in GF flies resulted in partial amelioration of a number of phenotypes, including survival, locomotor defects and glial activation. Similar beneficial effects were seen on modulation of the intestinal microbiota in Alzheimer's disease mouse and fly models [68\u201370] and α-Syn overexpressing (ASO) mice [71]. In the case of ASO mice, amelioration of the intestinal microbiome led to an improvement in neuropathology, whereas oral administration of specific microbial metabolites to GF mice promoted neuroinflammation and motor deficits. Interestingly, we show that the re-introduction of a single commensal bacteria from the gut of healthy control flies is sufficient to promote immune activation in Gba1b-/- flies in association with significant mortality."

Endotoxins predominantly refer to the lipopolysaccharide found in the outer cell wall of gram-negative bacteria [62]. We hypothesise that the intestinal inflammation and altered gut microbiome observed in our Gba1b-/- fly model promotes intestinal barrier permeability ('gut leakiness'). This in turn allows translocation of PAMPs\u2014 among them endotoxins and peptidoglycan fragments\u2014from the gut lumen into the systemic circulation [59, 72]. The increased intestinal transit time and increased bacterial load observed in Gba1b-/- flies may further promote this translocation due to the increased exposure of the gut wall to bacteria. The subsequent circulating microbial products can stimulate a chronic systemic innate immune activation [73], consequently leading to neuroinflammation [58, 74, 75]."

This is in agreement with recent studies that show degradation of IMD pathway mediators, such as Tak1/Tab2 and IKK complex is mediated by selective autophagy. Loss of normal autophagic flux results in constitutive activation of the IMD pathway [38, 39]. Thus, the autophagy impairment observed in the brain, gut and fat body tissue of Gba1b-/- flies may lead to an inability to terminate activated immune responses, through the degradation of key components of the NF-kB signalling cascades. In turn, this would lead to increased levels of AMPs.

Indeed, both knockout and overexpression of Rel was detrimental to Gba1b deficient flies. The survival of Gba1b-/-, RelE20 double mutants was significantly reduced under both GF and non-GF conditions, demonstrating that chronic suppression of IMD signalling is toxic to Gba1b-/- flies. Our data also indicate that gut bacterial load is likely partially contributing to the observed shortened lifespan, since Rel knockout in Gba1b-/- flies is less toxic under GF conditions. Ubiquitous and fat body overexpression of Rel in Gba1b-/- flies also reduces fly survival. Together these findings suggest that immune signaling requires fine-tuning in the context of Gba1b deficiency. In addition, studies have shown immune independent roles for Rel [76, 77]. These include regulation of the autophagy protein Atg1. It is therefore possible that dysregulation of non-immune pathways, such as autophagy, in response to knockdown or up-regulation of Rel, may contribute to the toxicity observed in Gba1b-/- flies, for example by potentiating the autophagy impairment observed in GCase deficiency."

Common genes at both time points were obtained by merging together the significant gene lists. These were further filtered by log2 fold change �2 at the latter time point generating common genes. Genes were visualised as a heat map created using the 'heatmply' R package v.1.1.0. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed using g:Profiler [82] (https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz369)."

Plates were incubated at 28̊C for three days and isolated colonies present in each plate were counted using a digital colony counter (Fisher Scientific). Five colonies for each morphological type were re-streaked onto new plates. To identify each isolate, a PCR was performed using part of a colony as a DNA template and 16S universal primers (27F and 1495R). The amplified amplicon was cleaned up using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and sent to Source Biosciences for sequencing. Identified isolates were grown in liquid medium containing 25% of glycerol (v/v) and frozen at -80 C."
