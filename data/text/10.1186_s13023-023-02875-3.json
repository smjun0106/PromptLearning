Population studies have identified GBA variants as risk factors for idiopathic PD. The increased risk of PD has also been suggested in other Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSDs). Objective: To assess the evolution of the prevalence of NMS compatible with PD in a cohort of South Brazilian adult patients with Gaucher Disease (GD) type 1, already evaluated 3 years ago (2018). Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) was collected to assess the levels of LSD enzymes (beta-hexosaminidases, beta-glucuronidase) and biomarker of macrophage activation (chitotriosidase, ChT), compared to controls (metachromatic leukodystrophy, MLD). Cognition was evaluated by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) questionnaire, daytime sleepiness by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), depression by Becḱs Inventory, constipation by the Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS) scale, and REM sleep behavior disorder by the single-question screen. Hyposmia was assessed with Sniffin' Sticks (SST)."

PD patients with GD-associated variants (PD-GBA) appear to have a different disease progression, developing dementia and psychosis significantly earlier than those without pathogenic variants [4]. Although GD patients carry two pathogenic variants in GBA, there is no significant difference in PD risk between homozygous and heterozygous carriers of GBA variants, as was previously believed [5]. The motor symptoms of PD can be preceded by a prodromal period of up to 20 years. The so-called non-motor symptoms (NMS) that occur during this prodrome, such as hyposmia, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep disorder, daytime drowsiness, constipation, depression, and anxiety, may represent the beginning of the pathological process of PD and appear to be more often found in PD-GBA [6, 7]."

ChT levels even correlated with the degree of severity of white matter lesions which corroborates to the importance of macrophages and astrocytes in the natural immune response of these demyelinative lesions [11, 12]. The more severe involvement of the brain in MLD might be the responsible for the higher levels of ChT found in this group in comparison to the GD patients. Higher levels of Cht in CSF were also demonstrated in other LSDs with more severe neurological involvement than GD1as GM1-gangliosidosis and GM2-gangliosidosis, for example [13]. Another possible explanation for this finding is that the GD group is treated with ERT which is already extensively associated with the lowering of ChT levels [14]. However, as this treatment doesn't cross the brain blood barrier and ChT is not clearly demonstrated to breach it, the ERT role on the lower levels of ChT in the GD group still needs to be further elucidated [15]."

In a study that analyzed α-syn, phosphorylated tau protein and lysosomal enzymes in CSF of 71 PD patients compared with 45 neurological controls, CSF GCase activity was significantly decreased, and HEX activity was moderately increased in the PD group [16]. HEX is associated with the Sandhoff disease caused by the accumulation of ganglioside GM2 and with shared features with PD including the α-syn inclusions frequently found in the Sandhoff disease brain of both patients and mouse models [8, 17]. Interestingly, a new study that biochemically characterize α-syn changes in the transgenic HEX knockout mice model showed that HEX expression decreases α-syn association to lipid compartments and prevented nigrostriatal accumulation of AAV6-overexpressed α-syn [17]. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that low HEX is described in the CSF of GD patients. We hypothesize that a lower HEX activity in GD might also be contributing to the increased risk of PD found in these patients; however, a bigger sample of patients is necessary to establish a better association."

We could not find any explanation in the literature for the increase of beta-glucuronidase seen in the GD group, as this enzyme was mostly associated with bacterial meningitis [18]. Currently, there is no treatment available that can stop the progression of PD. However, new studies suggest that re-establishing normal levels of GCase, which has been reported to be reduced in PD patients, may be a treatment option for patients carrying GBA variants, as demonstrated by some animal models [17, 19]. One limitation of our study was the availability of few lysosomal enzymatic assays and the restricted number of GD CSF samples, which did not allow for a proper assessment of the lysosomal environment in GD patients as intended."

After a three-year follow-up, it was interesting to note that the patient with the highest number of NMS and the lowest SST score was the one who developed PD after two years (P17). In a study that performed a six-year longitudinal evaluation of 31 GD1 patients, the GD subjects had significantly worse scores in UPSIT (Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test), UMSARS (Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale), MoCA, and MDS-UPDRS III compared to controls, with hyposmia being a predictive factor for deterioration in this population. Due to the importance of NMS in our cohort, we advocate for the routine assessment of smell, even by directed anamnesis, as multiple tools can be used in clinical practice to assess hyposmia [22]."

On the other hand, olfactory and cognitive assessments were lower in the GD group and did not differ significantly from baseline [23]. Although we followed up our patients for almost the same period, no consistent pattern was observed between both cohorts. One hypothesis for the lack of difference in our NMS follow-up compared to Avenali's and Beavan's cohorts might have been the older mean age of these cohorts (mean ages = 52 and 61 years, respectively) compared to ours [21, 23]."

However, this terminology has been criticized because the pathogenic variant N370S, which is considered \"mild,\" has great phenotypic heterogeneity. Homozygotes can remain asymptomatic for decades, while others can present severe clinical manifestations in childhood, including hepatosplenomegaly and pancytopenia [28]. It has been reported that motor, cognitive, olfactory, and psychiatric symptoms are more severe in PD carriers of \"severe\" GBA variants compared to those carrying mild or no GBA variants [26]. We could not find any difference in the NMS assessment between patients presenting at least one L444P allele and the rest of the cohort. Our single patient presenting motor symptoms (P17) only had \"mild\" variants, which leads to the hypothesis that other factors influence the neurodegeneration of PD beyond the patient's genotype."

We recommend a detailed neurological physical examination focusing on PD motor symptoms starting at the age of 30 in GD patients. HEX activity was lower in the CSF of patients when compared to the MLD group. More studies will be necessary to assess whether this could also be a contributing factor to the increased risk of PD in these patients. A combination of biomarkers, both clinical and in CSF, might help define the optimal time to intervene with neuroprotective therapy for PD when it becomes available."
