These clinical manifestations are common to all types of GD, but categorization depends on the absence of neurological involvement (type I) or its presence (type II and III). Cardiac involvement is rare and only reported in few cases, where valvular and aortic calcifications were associated with type IIIc.

On admission, his blood pressure was 126/86 mmHg, with a heart rate of 124 bpm. Cardiac auscultation found irregular rhythm, without murmurs or gallops. A Jugular venous distension, a hepatojugular reflux and a bilateral lower limb oedema limited to ankles were observed. Abdominal examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly.

    "text": "CMR was performed in order to study myocardial infiltration. Recently, Solanich assessed the GD cardiac involvement of a 62-year-old type I GD patient with no cardiac symptoms using CMR. LGE showed multiple foci consistent with interstitial infiltrative fibrosis in the basal and middle inferior and inferolateral segments, in addition to bi-atrial enlargement [14]. Similar findings are seen in our case, even if LGE was only located in the basal infero-septal segment. Without an objective histological examination, the focal interstitial fibrosis may correspond to a local reaction in response to sphingolipid infiltration."
