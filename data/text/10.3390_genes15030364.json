    "text": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a very heterogeneous disorder with varying clinical manifestations and severity. Classically, GD has been classified into three types, determined by the presence (or absence) and varying degree of neurological symptoms. Type 1 (GD1), or non-neuronopathic GD, is the most common form in the Western world and is enriched in the Ashkenazi Jewish population [1]. Systemic manifestations of GD frequently include hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and bone involvement, although some patients exhibit few or no symptoms of the disease. Acute neuronopathic type 2 (GD2) is the most severe form of the disease, with patients exhibiting rapid onset and progression of symptoms within the first few months of life, typically succumbing to the disease between infancy and age four. Type 3 (GD3), or chronic neuronopathic GD, presents with relatively milder neurological symptoms but a wider range of phenotypes. Neurological manifestations in neuronopathic GD (nGD) can range from slowed horizontal saccadic eye movements to myoclonus, ataxia, and seizures [2\u20134]. Due to its variable manifestations and overlapping features with other diseases, the diagnosis of GD can be difficult and even missed in those with milder or later-onset presentations of the disease. Making a timely diagnosis can be critical as, in many instances, there is an optimal time to begin treatment to avoid irreversible damage [5,6]. Treatment with the current therapies can be integral for reversing or preventing hematological and visceral involvement as well as improving patients' quality of life."

    "text": "Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is the first-line treatment for GD in patients of all ages. Current ERT for GD involves the administration of exogenously infused recombinant glucocerebrosidase to compensate for its deficiency [7]. There are three FDA-approved recombinant enzymes for Gaucher disease (imiglucerase, velaglucerase alfa, taliglucerase alfa), all of which are administered intravenously and appear to have similar efficacy [5]. Alleviation and reversal of most non-neuronopathic symptoms can be successfully achieved in most patients after an optimal dosage for the individual is determined [5,8]. Long-term cessation of enzyme replacement therapy often results in the reemergence of disease manifestations, albeit reversibly, so long as therapy is restarted in a timely fashion [8,9]. ERT is considered very safe, with reported side effects rarely warranting discontinuation of treatment [10]. However, despite its efficacy, ERT can be prohibitively expensive for many patients, limiting its availability for those who are unable to afford it, especially in developing nations [5,9,11]. Some patients cannot tolerate ERT due to poor venous access, allergy, or, in rare instances, hypersensitivity [11]. Coordinating infusions, which are typically administered in clinics, hospitals, or by home infusion nurses, can be challenging\u2014 an issue that was highlighted during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [9,12\u201314]. Furthermore, the recombinant enzyme is unable to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), rendering it ineffective for the neurological manifestations of GD observed in GD2 and GD3 [8,11,15]."

    "text": "For adults, including those unable to access or tolerate ERT, oral substrate reduction therapy (SRT) is a second option for the treatment of GD. While enzyme replacement therapy seeks to restore deficient glucocerebrosidase levels, substrate reduction therapy inhibits the rate of synthesis and subsequent accumulation of glycosphingolipid substrates [16]. There are currently two glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors approved as SRT for GD. Miglustat was the first SRT available [17]; it diffuses widely and rapidly into tissue and can cross the BBB, but many side effects have been reported [18]. A randomized controlled trial in 30 patients with GD3 failed to show significant neurological improvements following miglustat treatment [19]. The second SRT approved for GD, eliglustat tartrate, has greater efficacy and milder side effects than miglustat and is thus the most commonly used SRT [5,15,20]. However, eliglustat does not cross the BBB and is not approved for neuronopathic GD [21,22]. Dosing for eliglustat is dependent on the patient's CYP26 metabolism, and the therapy is not indicated for those who are ultra-rapid CYP26 metabolizers or have any degree of hepatic impairment [5,23]. Currently, children are excluded from the therapeutic indications for SRT\u2014an undesirable aspect given the importance of early treatment to prevent irreversible damage and developmental complications [24]. Furthermore, in contrast to ERT, the side effects observed with SRT are notably more severe, with a greater percentage of patients ending treatment as a result [5,25,26]. SRT is also still quite expensive\u2013another barrier for patients worldwide [27]. A brain penetrant SRT, venglustat, is currently in clinical trials [28]."

Although other treatments such as bone marrow transplant are practiced in countries unable to afford ERT or SRT, these methods are considered less effective and carry a higher risk of complications [27,29]. Additionally, no current therapies are effective against neurological manifestations of GD. Thus, there is a critical, unmet need for a more affordable solution for the treatment of GD that is also capable of improving the neuronopathic aspects of the disease. Gene therapy holds potential as a curative therapy for GD that could address the shortcomings associated with current treatment options."

    "text": "For many decades, gene therapy has been heralded as a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of different inherited disorders, including lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs). The ultimate goal of gene therapy is to modulate or manipulate the expression of genes in order to achieve a therapeutic effect in genetic disorders. This enables the introduction of healthy copies of a gene to replace diseased copies, the disruption of the functionality of diseased genes (through transcriptional or translational modifications), or the introduction of a novel gene for a therapeutic effect [30]. In gene therapy, the cargo (therapeutic gene) is delivered via a carrier (vector) to targeted cells. These vectors can be grouped broadly into viral and non-viral approaches. Non-viral gene therapy methods include synthetic polymers and natural polymers, which take advantage of organically derived cellular components [31,32]. Non-viral modalities offer relatively low immunogenic responses and are not limited by the size of the DNA inserts [33]. However, the poor selectivity and limited efficiency of genetic material transfer with non-viral gene therapy methods make viral gene therapy more attractive for therapeutic and clinical applications. Viral gene therapy uses vectors that are highly selective within target tissues, while also being versatile enough to differentiate amongst cells in different stages of the growth cycle [33]."

    "text": "Viruses that have been modified for gene therapy include retroviruses, adenoviruses, lentiviruses, and adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) [33]. Retroviruses rely on modifications of their long terminal repeats to deliver transgenes to the genome in a random integration format. However, they are associated with potential immunogenic and toxicity complications, posing safety concerns [34]. Adenoviruses were initially considered as a viable viral vector template due to their generally non-lethal properties when found in nature. However, the adenovirus may trigger a strong inflammatory response when injected into the host [35]. There are many adenovirus serotypes, but historically, group C human serotypes 2 and 5 have primarily been used in gene therapy, as they have potent transduction capacity [36]. The immunogenic risk of adenoviruses remains the primary limitation to their use as a gene therapy vector despite ongoing research [37]. Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) offer additional advantage with respect to immunogenic protection when compared to other viral vectors [34]. Although other viral vectors have been modified to prevent infection, AAVs have an additional level of separation from infectivity that makes them attractive candidates for gene therapy. The reliance of AAVs on helper viruses precludes an adaptive response, as they have been shown to be apathogenic in humans, an important distinction to consider when comparing them to other viruses that may have previously caused infection in patients and thus trigger a strong immune response in gene therapy [38]. Twelve AAV serotypes with at least one hundred variants have been identified [39]. Adeno-associated viruses contain a small single-stranded linear genome that allows for modifications and inserts. The heterogeneity amongst these variants enables modified AAV vectors to target multiple tissue types with high infectivity. While some serotypes appear to be specific to certain tissue types, the targets of other serotypes remain unclear [40]. Currently, tissue-specific promoters in conjunction with machine learning techniques are being used to engineer more target-specific AAVs [41]."

In gene therapy applications, the AAV genome is replaced with the desired foreign DNA, which is selectively designed for expression in tissues of interest. These DNA inserts encode specific transgene cassettes containing the therapeutic DNA, a regulatory sequence, a promoter, and a polyadenylation (poly(A)) signal, which ensure the appropriate mRNA processing and translation [43]. The variability amongst the many AAV serotypes further improves tissue-specific targeting and transduction into cells. The specific mechanisms for transduction into the cellular genome differ depending on the selected serotype and vector design but can include random integration of the vector genome into chromosomal regions [44] and episomal transgene expression [45]. Additionally, the safety profile of AAVs is associated with a lower immunogenic response and improved outcomes for transduction of the target gene into desired tissues and cells when compared to adenoviruses and retroviruses [34,46], suggesting that AAV is a more optimal viral gene therapy option for genetic diseases."

    "text": "Many LSDs, including GD, have neurological involvement. Gene therapy offers a special advantage for neurological disorders, as many of the vectors have unique properties that allow them to permeate the BBB. AAV vectors are efficient and highly selective at transducing tissues throughout the nervous system when used in conjunction with cell-typespecific promoters and enhancers [47,48], enabling their delivery to affected brain regions. AAVs can deliver therapeutic proteins, antibodies, micro-RNAs, or precise DNA insertions and deletions to alter the genomic profile of the host cells [49]. Pre-clinical studies have suggested that direct intravenous delivery of the AAVs may be as efficacious in reversing neuronopathic phenotypes as intracerebroventricular injections exclusively targeting the central nervous system (CNS) [50]. Furthermore, several previous and ongoing clinical trials offer a cautiously optimistic view of the therapeutic potential of AAV vectors for the treatment of neurological disorders [51], supporting their safety in a clinical setting and their overall efficacy. It has also been observed that recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors are less immunogenic in all tissue types (including neuronal) than adenoviral vectors [52\u201354]. These clinical trials support the safety of AAV gene therapy in the treatment of heritable disorders and neurological disorders, making it a reasonable therapeutic approach for GD."

Several studies have established a historical precedent demonstrating promise for GD as a viable candidate for gene therapy. Choudary et al. [55] were among the first to explore gene therapy for GD and successfully induced the expression of human glucocerebrosidase in mammalian cells via retroviral gene transfer. However, the expressed enzyme was inactive and did not rescue GCase levels. Shortly after, the successful transplantation of transfected bone marrow cells into murine models with recovery of macrophage and central nervous system microglia was reported [56]. Schiffman et al. provided support for the efficacy of retrovirally transduced bone marrow transplantation in mice with long-term survival through repeated injections of transduced stem cells [57]. In 1997 and 1998, three separate groups performed clinical trials to assess the developing technology. Schuening et al. introduced peripheral blood repopulating cells that had been transduced with a retroviral vector to patients. However, they were unable to produce successful engraftment of transduced cells [58]. In 1998, Dunbar et al. demonstrated long-term efficacious engraftment of infused gene-marked cells, but they were unable to show improved GCase activity in patients [59]. Barranger et al. transduced modified CD34+ cells into recipients and were able to observe sustained enzyme production in one patient for at least nine months [60]. These reported levels were sufficient for the patient to be weaned off ERT, but after 27 months, enzyme levels decreased and the patient had to resume infusion therapy. Several of these early studies supported the use of viral gene therapy, while cautioning about possible safety concerns related to potential oncogenic and immunogenic side effects of the therapy [61]. The shortcomings of these clinical trials supported the need for more vigorous pre-clinical studies."

Marshall et al. also used an artificially induced murine model of GD by treating BALB/c mice with conduritol-β-epoxide (CBE) and glucocerebroside-containing liposomes to inhibit GCase activity and increase glycosphingolipid levels, respectively. These mice accumulated GluCer in the lysosomal compartments of liver macrophages (Kupffer cells), effectively replicating one of the biological hallmarks of GD. The group demonstrated that gene transfer-induced secreted GCase could localize to Kupffer cells despite being unmodified and that it had a longer half-life than the modified enzyme administered in ERT.

After repeated intraperitoneal tamoxifen injections, the Gba11flox/flox;UBCCreERT2 mice rapidly display weight loss, motor dysfunction (including abnormal gait and hyperextension of the neck), and seizures, and died within 7 days after induction. Gaucher cells were observed in the brain, liver, and spleen, and GCase activity was significantly reduced in the brain, liver, and spleen [69]. The Gba1flox/flox, UBC-CreERT2 mouse provides a viable model that mimics the systemic and CNS involvement observed in nGD, and the conditional nature of the model allows flexibility to study the effects of therapy in mice at different ages."

A low dose of the vector was also able to clear GluCer levels from Kupffer cells despite producing levels of GCase that were not detected in serum, likely due to the enhanced ability of adenoviruses to directly transduce Kupffer cells [62].

To ease this concern and further reduce their oncogenic risk, self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vectors have been developed by removing the transcriptional elements of HIV-1 [89,90]. Dahl et al. transduced bone marrow cells with SIN lentiviral vectors and transplanted them into pre-symptomatic and symptomatic Mx1-Cre+ Gba1flox/null mice. They compared the safety and efficacy of two SIN lentiviral vectors containing the human phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) and CD68 promoters, respectively, against an SIN lentiviral vector with the SFFV promoter [68]. PGK is a relatively weak promoter that produces physiological rather than supraphysiological gene expression and is expressed ubiquitously, whereas CD68 is a macrophage-specific promoter [91,92]. Both vectors successfully reversed splenomegaly, elevated GCase activity, and prevented GluCer accumulation in the bone marrow, spleen, and liver when administered pre-symptomatically. In mice that had already developed symptoms, both vectors also significantly increased GCase activity. However, in contrast to the SFFV-positive control vector, which increased activity levels to 9.5 fold of wild-type levels, neither the PGK nor CD68 SIN lentiviral vectors restored GCase activity to wild-type levels. Nonetheless, the resulting activity levels were sufficient to reduce GluCer accumulation and dramatically reduce the number of Gaucher cells. Mice treated with either vector also exhibited near-normal spleen size as well as improvement in several blood parameters. All vectors displayed sustained expression up to at least 20 weeks. The SFFV promoter produced the highest levels of GBA1 expression across all evaluated tissue types and cellular subsets, including progenitor cells. The CD68 and PGK promoters both expressed the transgene in tissue, lymphoid compartments, and granulocytes, but the CD68 promoter resulted in higher transgene expression in monocytes and macrophages. Thus, although the PGK and CD68 promoters produced less robust results than the SFFV promoter, they were still capable of preventing and reversing the GD1 phenotype without the safety risks associated with a stronger promoter like SFFV."

The nGD mice that were injected in utero did not develop behavioral symptoms, neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, or evidence of storage for up to 35 days. Longer-term analysis indicated that mice treated in utero appeared normal and fertile at day 70. However, by day 100, these mice performed worse on motor tasks, weighed less than wild-type littermates, and exhibited higher than normal microglial activation and astrogliosis. GCase activity and GluCer levels were similar to wild-type, although higher levels of other glycosphingolipids were detected. Thus, this AAV9 vector was effective in preventing neonatal death and delaying onset of symptoms but appeared to lose potency later in development. Massaro et al. also examined the utility of their vector when administered intravenously or intracerebroventricularly in newborns. No behavioral changes or weight loss was observed in treated nGD mice for up to at least 180 days, regardless of delivery method. Supraphysiological and physiological levels of GCase were observed in various brain regions. Evidence of neuronal loss and cortical thinning was observed in several brain regions of mice treated via IV infusion. In visceral organs, both delivery methods significantly increased GCase levels, with the IV route preventing splenomegaly and development of Gaucher cells. However, intracerebroventricular administration did not ameliorate visceral pathology despite the increased GCase. Therefore, while the AAV9 vector was able to prevent neonatal lethality in all cases, it was most effective against both neurological and visceral symptoms when delivered postnatally via IV injection [50]."

Conversely, the ubiquitous expression of AAV9 may result in undesired off-target toxic side effects [101]. To overcome this limitation, other serotypes such as AAVrh10 have been developed.

The conversion of ssAAVs to their double-stranded counterparts may also reduce the efficacy of the vector. An alternate AAV construct that has been proposed uses a self-complementary vector (scAAV), which contains an inverted dimeric repeat genome that folds into dsDNA without the aid of DNA synthesis molecules. These vectors have been notably effective at transducing multiple tissue types, including nervous tissue, and circumventing the limitations associated with the conversion of ssAAVs. Vector construct size in scAAVs must be reduced to approximately 2500 base pairs to prevent the dimeric repeats from exceeding the size limitations of the normal AAV packaging capacity (approximately 4700 nucleotides); the two halves of the scAAV are thus complementary.

    "text": "Although AAVs do not cause significant infection without the aid of a secondary viral host, they could still trigger an unpredictable immune response for a variety of reasons. Antibodies to previous infection by AAVs or adenoviruses may conceivably diminish the response to the therapy or prevent a response altogether and could be dangerous to the patient [105]. A prior adenoviral infection with a similar serotype of adenovirus may result in a strong immune response post-treatment. This could give rise to serious complications including meningitis, encephalitis, and, in rare cases, death. The immunogenicity can also be impacted by insertional mutagenesis, which can preclude genotoxicity [106]. There are alarming reports in both mammalian models and human subjects of the genotoxicity resulting in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [107], despite most cases in humans being episomal and benign. Thus, it is crucial to consider vector design with respect to possible undesirable integrations into the host genome to avoid carcinogenic outcomes [101]. One side effect that has been observed in clinical trials of AAV gene therapy in other neurological diseases is thrombotic microangiopathy, which is associated with an immune activation that gives rise to vascular pathologies and may result in ischemia of the brain and other organs [99]. This may be overcome by consideration of alternate administration routes of AAV such as intra-CSF infusions, which could reduce the availability of circulating AAV [99]."

    "text": "Treating GD2 is particularly challenging, as the window between time of diagnosis and irreversible neurological damage may be very small. However, newborn screening campaigns have allowed for identification of cases prior to symptom development, which may be integral to administering treatment early enough to drastically alter the disease course. It still remains possible, however, that irreversible CNS damage in GD2 has already begun prenatally, as elevated glucosylsphingosine levels have been documented during early gestation [108]. Nevertheless, we remain cautiously optimistic that viral gene therapy can be used to ameliorate the symptoms in at least some forms of neuronopathic GD. These therapies should be examined thoroughly and developed carefully to improve the outcomes for individuals with nGD."

    "text": "There are some ethical concerns that persist regarding the use of gene therapy in young patients. There is still inadequate clinical data to conclude that these gene therapy modalities will completely reverse\u2014or cure\u2014disease progression and manifestations. As such, they may only partly treat a patient's disease at a potentially very high cost [100]. Partial therapy in GD2 may prolong, but not prevent, the neurodegenerative course. Furthermore, patients may need to continue to receive additional costly therapies. The risk of minimal improvements to a patient's quality of life is thus important to consider and to further examine through ongoing pre-clinical and clinical trials. However, there are indications of promising results of viral gene therapy in other LSDs [100]. We thus believe that the further development and evaluation of improved gene therapy vectors, modes of administration, and construct optimization can ultimately be of significant benefit to patients with all forms of GD."
