Deficiency ofGAA results in pathological glycogen accumulation in the lysosomes of multiple tissues, especially cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscles (1). Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) presents in the first few days to weeks of life (1).

The response to ERT has been heterogeneous and is affected by multiple factors including cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM) status (i.e., presence or absence of any GAA expression), anti-rhGAA antibodies, age at diagnosis, dose of ERT (recommended dose \u2013 20 mg/kg every other week), and extent ofmuscle damage at the time of treatment initiation (5). The development of high titer IgG antibodies against ERT can affect pharmacokinetics, and result in the need for invasive ventilation associated with disease progression despite high doses of ERT. It can also result in infusion-associated reactions (IARs) (6\u20138). The rapid elimination ofcells that produce high titer anti-rhGAA IgG antibodies is very important in IOPD because disease progression is extremely rapid, and a delay in initiation of treatment by even a few days can impact the outcome (9\u201311)."

For patients who are CRIM-positive, who are typically considered to be at lower risk of developing anti-rhGAA antibodies, ITI with transient low-dose methotrexate (TLD-MTX) has been successful at inducing tolerance (13). Despite the progress made in immunomodulation approaches used in the ERT-naïve setting, some patients have a break in tolerance. The use of plasma cell targeting agents such as bortezomib (a proteasome inhibitor that affects both short-lived and long-lived plasma cells) and daratumumab (an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody) in combination with rituximab, methotrexate, and IVIG has been successful in eliminating high-sustained anti-rhGAA antibody titers (HSAT) against ERT in patients with Pompe disease and other lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) (14, 15). However, elimination of HSAT is a challenge, often requiring prolonged immune suppression to ensure long-term immune tolerance."

The reduction in anti-rhGAA IgG antibody titers led to the improvement in overall clinical status; a decrease in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) with normalization of LVMI in two patients, a significant reduction in urinary glucose tetrasaccharide (Glc4), less dependence on mechanical ventilation and enteral feeding, and improvement in motor status. Despite the success of the protocol, the duration of immune suppression was necessarily long to overcome the entrenched anti-rhGAA immune response."

    "text": "To better understand antibody titer trends that could help us differentiate IOPD patients who are at risk for HSAT vs. low titers in the early phase of ERT treatment, potentially identifying patients who would benefit from earlier intervention, longitudinal anti-rhGAA antibody response in 37 CRIM-positive IOPD patients was analyzed (20). Of these 37 patients, 12 (32%) patients developed antibody titers of ≥12,800. In these patients who developed HSAT (n=12), the median time since ERT to first develop a titer of ≥12,800 was 10 weeks (range, 4-24 weeks). Twenty-five CRIM-positive IOPD patients who maintained antibody titers of <12,800 were classified as low titer patients. The median time to seroconversion in the low titer group was 8 weeks (range, 4-64 weeks) on ERT. The data suggested that the Pompe disease patients who will not tolerize to ERT are those who mount titers of ≥12,800 and an upward trend of antibody titers within the first 24 weeks on ERT. The data generated from this chart review identified different arcs in immune response to ERT after the initial exposure, which has allowed us to identify high-risk patients earlier in order to initiate bortezomib-based ITI."

Both newly reported patients failed to achieve durable immune tolerance despite routine immune modulation with TLD-MTX in the ERT-naïve setting. Both patients subsequently received rescue ITI with a bortezomib-based protocol at the earliest recognition of elevated titers. The number of bortezomib cycles at the time of initiation differed, however, which drastically changed the trajectory of the response. Through these cases and our previously published cases, we highlight the need for close monitoring of anti-rhGAA antibodies and an aggressive approach at the outset to allow for success in reducing anti-rhGAA antibodies."

The clinical data including GAA variants, CRIM status, age at ERT, anti-rhGAA antibody titer trends, and biomarkers were analyzed. Upon identification of a Pompe disease patient with HSAT, the detailed ITI protocol including the dosing schedule of immunomodulatory agents (bortezomib, rituximab, methotrexate, and IVIG) and safety monitoring was shared with the patient's treating physician. Anti-rhGAA IgG antibody titers were determined by Sanofi Genzyme and/or LabCorp as previously described (36). Urinary Glc4 was determined as described previously (21, 22). All the relevant information was extracted from medical records provided by the principal care provider or physician of the respective patient. These patients' medical records were examined and analyzed up until April 2023. The lessons from 37 CRIM-positive IOPD cases treated with ERT monotherapy previously published by our group helped in defining optimal timing for initiating a Pompe disease patient on a bortezomib-based ITI protocol (20). The endpoints such as age at diagnosis, age at ERT initiation, highest anti-rhGAA IgG antibody titer, time on ERT at bortezomib initiation, duration between development HSAT titer to bortezomib initiation, number of bortezomib cycles, and antibody titer at study end were compared to six previously published patients (patients 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7) who were treated with the same ITI approach (14, 16, 17).

To minimize the negative impact of anti-rhGAA antibodies, immune modulation approaches in the ERT-naïve settings have been utilized with great success and have become a standard of care in patients with IOPD, especially CRIM-negative IOPD. However, a subset of CRIM-positive IOPD patients (32%) can develop significant anti-rhGAA antibodies leading to suboptimal clinical response (20, 23). CRIM-positive IOPD patients who are likely to develop HSAT to ERT show an upward antibody titer trend with titers of ≥12,800 within the first 24 weeks on ERT (20). Published literature has demonstrated that prophylactic ITI is associated with shorter immune suppression and minimal side effects compared to therapeutic ITI. Additionally, patients who have been tolerant to ERT can have a break in tolerance as seen in Patient 5 who developed HSAT after been immune tolerant to ERT for 11 years (18). Considering these, both patients in this report were treated with TLD-MTX ITI in the ERT-naïve setting. Patient 8 completed the protocol without any deviations whereas the ITI administration schedule was altered in Patient 6 due to RSV, viral infections, and severe mucositis. The knowledge gained from an ERT-treated historical cohort of CRIM-positive IOPD patients allowed us to recognize the break in tolerance in these patients, and these data have helped us predict the trajectory of patients destined to develop HSAT (20, 23)."

Rituximab targets and effectively depletes cells that express CD20, which includes most members of the B cell lineage from pro-B cells to memory B cells (24). CD19+CD20- plasma cells, however, and certain subsets of long-lived memory B cells are resistant to rituximab and have been detected in the weeks to months after treatment for various antibody-mediated diseases (25, 26). Furthermore, B cells with decreased or absent cell-surface CD20 have been frequently detected after rituximab treatment, and are thought to survive as a result of epitope masking, antigen modulation by CD20 internalization, and/or trogocytosis that can allow for B cell escape and persistence [reviewed in (27)]. While treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) with rituximab to eliminate anti-platelet B cells is initially effective for many (~60%) patients, rituximab treatment itself has also been associated with enhanced differentiation and establishment of long-lived plasma cells in some patients with non-responsive or recurrent disease (25). Data from mouse studies demonstrated that rituximab's enhancing effect on long-lived plasma cells depends on the influence of splenic CD4+ T cells and the cytokine B-cell activating factor (BAFF) (28). Given that some plasma cells and memory B cells can escape depletion by rituximab alone, we recognized the importance of targeting plasma cells by using an agent such as bortezomib during the induction ofimmune tolerance following the development of HSAT."

Despite the initial success of the bortezomib-based approach in inducing immune tolerance, we recognized the potential to optimize this approach by identifying patients earlier and using shorter courses of ITI (Supplementary Figure 2). The antibody titers in patients 1, 2, 3, and 4 (previously published) peaked at 204,800 to 819,200 and had HSAT for a duration of 22 to 111 weeks before initiation of bortezomib-based ITI (Table 1).

The upward trend of antibody titers within the first 24 weeks on ERT stood out as a key feature that differentiated patients with HSAT from those that had persistent low titers; the low titer group did not demonstrate an upward trend in antibody titers after initial exposure to ERT, suggesting their effective immune tolerance to ERT.

    "text": "The two IOPD patients presented herein, who developed HSAT in spite of their CRIM-positive status, serve as examples of the importance of identifying high-risk CRIM-positive IOPD patients by regular monitoring of anti-rhGAA antibody titers. Both patients received TLD-MTX ITI in an ERT-naïve setting, and while a major deviation in the administration schedule may have contributed to the failure of the initial ITI regimen in patient 6, patient 8 had no such deviation. Furthermore, patient 8 developed antibodies to ERT despite early identification and initiation of ERT within one month of age. As shown in the present study, both patients were initiated on bortezomib-based ITI at the earliest evidence of high titers. A reduction in antibody titers was observed in both cases with antibody titers decreasing from 25,600 to seronegative at the study end. During their initial treatment with bortezomib, patient 8 received 2 consecutive cycles (8 doses) of bortezomib whereas patient 6 received only 1 cycle (4 doses) of bortezomib. The impact of this difference can be seen in the outcome of these two patients; patient 8 required an overall shorter duration of immunomodulation to bring antibody titers down and tolerize to ERT, continued to receive ERT without any ITI, and maintained low antibody titers even after B cell recovery. In contrast, patient 6 required an additional 3 cycles of bortezomib to bring antibody titers down and is still receiving rituximab and subcutaneous IgG. The sum of these experiences (current and previously published cases) strongly suggests that adopting a strategy of early and aggressive intervention at the earliest recognition of high anti-ERT antibody titers may ultimately result in optimized long-term immune tolerance and improved clinical outcomes. Furthermore, the success of a therapeutic regimen meant to eliminate HSAT relies on the inclusion of an agent that effectively targets and eliminates the plasma cells that are responsible for anti-ERT antibodies, such as bortezomib."

    "text": "Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor that was initially used for hematologic malignancies such as multiple myeloma, and targets cells with high rates of protein production by inducing cell death via the terminal unfolded protein response (30). After the discovery that it also targets short- and long-lived plasma cells as a result of their active antibody production (30), it has been found to be efficacious for the treatment of antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases and solid-organ transplant rejection (31). One of bortezomib's most attractive features in the treatment of antibody-mediated disease is its ability to target non-dividing plasma cells that have high rates of antibody production. Given the ability of CD19+CD20- plasma cells to escape death by anti-CD20 targeting agents like rituximab, bortezomib provides a crucial adjunctive therapy to eliminate plasma cells that are generated after ERT therapy is initiated in IOPD. The existence of such cells is demonstrated by the presence of high-titer anti-ERT antibodies. A challenge remains, however, that some memory B cells also appear to be able to survive rituximab therapy by down-regulating CD20, and may therefore be able to re-emerge and participate in recurrent antibody responses (27, 32). In addition to these surviving memory B cells, nascent naïve B cells may participate in recurrent HSAT responses (32). Given that the patients described in this report were able to mount primary HSAT responses despite their CRIM-positive status and their initial ITI, it may suggest that these patients also have an underlying heightened risk for recurrence due to nascent naïve B cells. This further supports our recommendation for close monitoring of such high-risk patients."

In a recently published study, we published the results of multiparameter immunophenotyping and multiplex array analysis elucidating the cellular subsets and cytokine mediators that drive the immune response to ERT in IOPD patients (33). The comparison of low-risk IOPD patients treated with ERT monotherapy with high-risk IOPD patients who received ITI (rituximab, methotrexate, and IVIG) in ERT-naïve, the data suggested that the immune profile of high-risk IOPD patients was similar to low-risk IOPD patients which might be attributed to treatment with ITI. The data suggested that ITI administration changes the immune profile of IOPD patients who were at higher risk of mounting immune response to ERT to more of the immune profile of IOPD patients who have some level of natural tolerance to ERT. This study further demonstrated the success of ITI in inducing immune tolerance, however, identifying these high-risk patients remains a challenge. More importantly, additional methods to identify these high-risk Pompe disease patients at outset are needed; such methods could be incorporated in the Newborn screening algorithm to maximize the benefits of enzyme replacement."
