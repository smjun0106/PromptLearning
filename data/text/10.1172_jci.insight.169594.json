Variations in GBA1 are considered as one of the most important risk factors for PD, with approximately 5%\u201310% of patients with PD carrying a GBA1 variation (5\u20138). Several studies have found reduced GCase activity in idiopathic PD cases in individuals not carrying GBA1 variations (9\u201313), suggesting an important role for GCase activity in the pathogenesis of PD. Clinically, patients with PD with GBA1 variants show an earlier age at onset, more rapid disease progression, and higher rates of nonmotor symptoms, such as rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and cognitive impairment, compared with those with non-GBA1\u2013associated PD (14\u201316). Moreover, variants of GBA1 are also known to increase the risk of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (17\u201320). Homozygous or compound heterozygous GBA1 mutations cause the lysosomal storage disease Gaucher disease (GD), due to severe loss of GCase activity (21, 22)."

    "text": "Supporting the strong genetic involvement of the GBA1 in PD, impaired GCase activity has been shown to cause α-synuclein aggregates in animal and in vitro cell culture models (12, 23\u201326). Several cellular pathways involving altered sphingolipid profile, autophagy-lysosomal dysfunction, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress have been suggested as pathogenic mechanisms of GBA1-PD (12, 27\u201333). Most of PD-associated GBA1 variations lead to a reduction in GCase activity in lysosomes, due to impaired GCase transport from the ER to the lysosome, reduced intrinsic enzymatic activity of the GCase, or a haplo-insufficiency of GBA1 gene (34\u201336). Thus, restoring the reduced GCase activity in the lysosome is crucial to combatting GBA1-associated diseases, and multiple therapeutic approaches have been developed. Misfolded GCase proteins with pathogenic genetic variations are retained in the ER and undergo ER-associated degradation (ERAD), resulting in a reduction in GCase protein levels in lysosomes (36, 37). Ambroxol, a well-known expectorant, has been reported to facilitate lysosomal transport of misfolded GCase proteins by acting as a chemical chaperone of the misfolded GCase protein in the ER. Ambroxol has been reported to increase both the lysosomal fraction and the enzymatic activity of GCase variants in fibroblasts from patients with GD (38, 39). In addition to chemical chaperoning of the misfolded GCase protein, other therapeutic strategies such as adeno-associated virus\u2013mediated (AAV-mediated) recombinant WT GCase transport or chemical GCase activators have recently been developed (40\u201343). Since each individual therapeutic strategy has specific strengths and limitations, it will be important to have multiple therapeutic strategies to combat the disease. Here, we present a potentially novel therapeutic strategy that targets GCase stability in lysosomes. Conceptually, inhibition of GCase degradation in lysosomes should increase GCase protein abundance and activity in lysosomes. However, it is still unknown which proteases are directly involved in GCase degradation in lysosomes. In this study, we show that lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin L regulated GCase stability and suggest that chemical inhibition of cathepsin L activity represents a potential therapeutic strategy for GBA1-associated PD and related diseases."

In particular, cathepsin L has been previously implicated in the proteolytic processing of progranulin, suggesting its potential role in the pathogenesis of frontotemporal dementia (47). To explore potentially novel cellular functions of cathepsin L, we generated 4 independent cathepsin L\u2013KO human embryonic kidney 293-FT (HEK293-FT) cell lines by using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Immunoblot analysis using cathepsin L antibody confirmed complete loss of cathepsin L protein in 4 cathepsin L\u2013KO cell lines (Figure 1A and Supplemental Figure 1A; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.169594DS1). Consistent with the previous report demonstrating that cathepsin L degrades lysosomal protease cathepsin D in cells (48), both mature and immature cathepsin D protein levels were elevated in 4 independent cathepsin L\u2013KO cell lines (Figure 1A and Supplemental Figure 1A). Notably, we found that GCase protein levels were significantly elevated in the 4 cathepsin L\u2013KO cell lines, compared with the WT cells (Figure 1A and Supplemental Figure 1A). While the levels of lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) were not changed, the levels of LIMP-2, a receptor for lysosomal transport of GCase (49), were increased in cathepsin L\u2013KO lines (Figure 1A and Supplemental Figure 1A). Lysosomal GCase activity is regulated by saposin C that acts as a physiological activator of GCase (50\u201353). We found that Saposin C levels and the ratio of Saposin C to prosaposin were increased in cathepsin L\u2013KO cells (Figure 1A and Supplemental Figure 1A), suggesting that cathepsin L may be involved in the degradation of saposin C in lysosomes."

The colocalization of GCase and LIMP-2 was also significantly increased in the cathepsin L\u2013KO cells (KO#1), compared with the WT cells (Figure 1B). The immunostaining of GCase and LIMP-2 proteins in 2 additional cathepsin L\u2013KO cell lines (KO#3 and KO#4) also showed similar results (Supplemental Figure 2). Unlike canonical sorting receptors that cycle between the Golgi and lysosomes, LIMP-2 resides mainly in the lysosomes (49), suggesting that higher colocalization of GCase with LIMP-2 was due to increased GCase abundances in the lysosome. Consistent with the data from the CRISPR cathepsin L\u2013KO cell lines, the transient knockdown of endogenous cathepsin L with 2 independent RNAi constructs also increased the levels of GCase, LIMP-2, and cathepsin D (Supplemental Figure 3). To confirm the finding in vivo, we found that GCase protein levels were significantly increased in the cathepsin L\u2013KO mouse brain lysates, compared with WT mouse lysates (Figure 1C), further indicating that cathepsin L regulates GCase levels."

    "text": "Lysosomal GCase activity is increased in the cathepsin L\u2013KO cells. To determine whether the increased GCase protein level in the cathepsin L\u2013KO cells resulted in an increased GCase activity, we first performed in vitro GCase activity assay by using cell lysates and 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (4-MUG), an artificial fluorometric GCase substrate. As shown in Figure 2A and Supplemental Figure 1B, the lysates of cathepsin L\u2013KO cells showed higher in vitro GCase activity, compared with the WT cell lysates. However, it is worth pointing out that this in vitro GCase assay using extracted cell lysates and 4-MUG substrate does not account for proper lysosomal targeting of GCase, lysosomal pH, or the presence of cofactor that could influence GCase activity in living cells. To address this concern, we used 2 independent cell penetrant artificial GCase substrates to assay GCase activity in living cells. Using 5-(Pentafluorobenzoylamino) Fluorescein Di-β-D-Glucopyranoside (PFB-FDGlu), a fluorescent quenched probe that yields fluorescein fluorescence upon hydrolysis by GCase (54), we show that GCase activity was significantly increased in the cathepsin L\u2013KO cells, compared with the WT cells (Figure 2B). In order to examine lysosomal GCase activity, we visualized fluorescent cleavage product of lysosome-targeted GCase substrate (GlucGreen), whereby lysosome-targeted GCase substrates become fluorescent only upon GCase enzymatic activity (55). Using this assay, we found that cathepsin L\u2013KO cells displayed a significant increase in fluorescence intensity, compared with the WT cells (Figure 2C). Next, we tested whether GluCer levels were altered in the cathepsin L\u2013KO cells, since GluCer is the primary lipid substrate of GCase enzyme. Indeed, immunofluorescence staining using an anti-GluCer antibody showed that GluCer levels are significantly reduced in the cathepsin L\u2013KO cells, compared with the WT cells (Figure 2D). The lipidomic investigation using mass spectrometry (MS) revealed a significant reduction in the total GluCer levels in the cathepsin L\u2013KO cell line. Notably, GluCer species characterized by very long acyl chains (such as C24, C24:1, C25, C26, and C26:1) showed a more consistent and pronounced decrease in the cathepsin L\u2013KO cell line, while GluCer species with C16 and C22 acyl chains exhibited a modest decrease (Figure 2E)."

    "text": "Cathepsin L cleaves GCase in vitro, and regulates GCase stability in cells. To determine whether GCase can be cleaved by cathepsin L, we first performed in vitro cleavage assay using purified recombinant cathepsin L and GCase proteins. The in vitro cleavage assay showed that GCase proteins are readily degraded by the coincubation with recombinant cathepsin L (Figure 3A). The time-course experiment of in vitro cleavage assay showed that cathepsin L cleaves most of GCase proteins within a minute (Figure 3B). Furthermore, to monitor GCase stability in cells, we utilized cycloheximide, an inhibitor for protein translation (56). Compared with the WT cells, the cathepsin L\u2013KO cells showed a slowed GCase reduction in the presence of cycloheximide, indicating that GCase stability is increased by the loss of cathepsin L in cells (Figure 3C). The increased GCase stability could be due to potentially altered lysosomal proteolysis activity of the cathepsin L\u2013KO cells, since cathepsin L is one of the many lysosomal proteases. To address this, we measured total lysosomal proteolysis by DQ-Red BSA protease activity assay (57). This technique relies on cleavage of the self-quenched DQ-Red BSA protease substrates in lysosomes and other acidic compartments to generate a highly fluorescent product. Using this approach, we found that the proteolysis activity was not impaired in the cathepsin L\u2013KO cells, compared with the WT cells (Figure 3D). Similar to our results, a recent study also found that cathepsin L loss in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells impaired neither DQ-BSA degradation nor general protein catabolism (58\u201360). Considering that cathepsin D, a previously known cathepsin L substrate, is significantly increased in the cathepsin L\u2013KO cells (Figure 1A), the increased DQ-Red BSA protease activity could be due to potential compensatory upregulation of other lysosomal proteases, including cathepsin D."

Despite the complete loss of cathepsin L, the clearance rates of both ubiquitinated intracellular proteins and LC3B, an autophagy adaptor, induced by nutrient starvation were not significantly different between the cathepsin L\u2013KO and WT cells (Supplemental Figure 4), suggesting that the loss of cathepsin L did not affect the lysosomal degradation capacity.

    "text": "Chemical inhibition of cathepsin L increases GCase level, in vitro GCase activity, and live cell GCase activity in microglial cells andpatient-derivedfibroblasts. It has been reported that the expression levels of both cathepsin L and GCase are higher in microglia than in other cells of the brain (62). It is conceivable that microglial cells may be affected by GCase deficiency, since macrophages are severely affected in patients with GD (21, 63). Although GCase function in microglia has not been studied at a molecular level, several studies suggest that GCase deficiency causes microglial dysfunction (64\u201368). Hence, we asked whether the cathepsin L\u2013mediated GCase regulation also operates in microglia. As a model system, we utilized the Human Microglia Clone 3 (HMC3) cells, an immortalized human microglia cell line derived from human fetal brain primary microglia culture (69). The HMC3 cell is known to express IBA1, a microglia/macrophage-specific calcium binding protein, and the mRNA expression of microglia-lineage markers (P2RY12 and CSF1R) in HMC3 cells has been previously reported (69). In vitro GCase activity and GCase protein levels in HMC3 cells were approximately a third of those observed in HEK293-FT cells (Supplemental Figure 5). We used a chemical inhibitor of cathepsin L to test whether cathepsin L activity regulates GCase abundance in the microglial HMC3 cells. To avoid potential covalent irreversible inhibition of other related lysosomal cysteine family proteases, we used a reversible cathepsin L inhibitor (SB 412515, a reversible peptidyl aldehyde inhibitor of cathepsin L) (70). SB 412515 exhibits a 30-fold preference for inhibiting cathepsin L over cathepsin K (71). We found that the treatment of the microglial HMC3 cells with SB 412515 increased both GCase and LIMP-2 levels (Figure 4A), whereas neither LAMP1 nor ubiquitinated protein levels were changed (Figure 4A). Consistent with our data that genetic KO of the cathepsin L gene resulted in a significant increase in both immature and mature forms of cathepsin D (Figure 1A and Supplemental Figure 1A), treatment with SB 412515 led to a significant increase in the levels of immature forms of cathepsin D, whereas the levels of mature forms of cathepsin D remained unchanged (Figure 4A). Of note, SB 412515 also increased mature cathepsin L levels (Figure 4A), presumably due to the stabilization of inactive cathepsin L bound to the cathepsin L inhibitor. Supporting the data that the SB 412515 treatment increased GCase protein level, we also found increased GCase activity in HMC3 cell lysates (Figure 4B). The majority of this GCase activity was abolished by CBE, an irreversible inhibitor of GCase (Figure 4B). When we also analyzed live cell GCase activity using the LysoLive GCase activity assay, the HMC3 cells treated with SB 412515 displayed a significant increase in fluorescence intensity (Figure 4C), indicating that lysosomal GCase activity was increased by the chemical inhibition of cathepsin L in microglial cells."

To further explore the impact of GBA1 deficiency on cathepsin L protein levels, we established a GBA1-KO human microglial cell line 3 (HMC3) and utilized a previously characterized GBA1-KO HEK293-FT cell line (28). Biochemical analysis of these GBA1-KO cell lines revealed significant increases in the mature form of cathepsin L, in comparison with their respective parental WT controls (Supplemental Figure 6 for HMC3 cell line and Supplemental Figure 7 for HEK293-FT cell line). Interestingly, no notable changes were observed in the levels of the immature form of cathepsin L. Additionally, both the GBA1-KO HMC3 and GBA1-KO HEK293-FT cell lines exhibited a substantial decrease in the levels of mature cathepsin D when compared with their parental WT controls (Supplemental Figure 6 for HMC3 cell line and Supplemental Figure 7 for HEK293-FT cell line). This finding aligns with previous research suggesting cathepsin L's involvement in cathepsin D degradation within lysosomes (48)."

Indeed, the treatment of GD fibroblast cells with SB 412515 increased both GCase and LIMP-2 levels (Figure 5A). The levels of pro at lower band (not quantified), intermediate, and mature forms of cathepsin L were also increased by SB 412515 treatment (Figure 5A). The levels of lysosomal proton pump subunit ATP6V1D, mature cathepsin D, and LAMP1 remained unchanged following SB 412515 treatment, whereas the levels of immature cathepsin D were increased (Figure 5A). Supporting these data, immunofluorescence staining using GCase antibody or LIMP-2 antibody also showed that both GCase (Figure 5B) and LIMP-2 protein levels (Supplemental Figure 8), as well as GCase activity, were increased by the SB 412515 treatment of GD fibroblasts (Figure 6A). Moreover, both PFB-FDGlu GCase assay (Figure 6B) and LysoLive GCase assay (Figure 6C) showed that the SB 412515 treatment in GD fibroblast cells increased lysosomal GCase activity in living cells. In addition, we found that GluCer levels in GD fibroblasts were significantly reduced by the SB 412515 treatment, as assayed with immunofluorescence staining using an anti-GluCer antibody (Figure 6D). To further examine the effects of SB 412515 in L444P fibroblast cells, we conducted a MS-based lipid analysis (Figure 6E). The lipidomic study revealed that the L444P fibroblast cell line contained 4 major GluCer species (C16-GluCer, C22-GluCer, C24-GluCer, and C24:1-GluCer). Treating the L444P fibroblast cells with SB 412515 for a day did not result in a significant reduction in total GluCer levels. However, upon analyzing individual GluCer species, we found that C16-GluCer exhibited a notable 24% reduction with SB 412515 treatment, whereas C22, C24, and C24:1-GluCer did not exhibit statistically significant changes (Figure 6E). These findings suggest that C16-GluCer may have a shorter half-life in cells compared with other GluCer species with longer acyl chains."

Since our data show that cathepsin L regulates GCase abundance in nonneuronal cells, we next examined whether cathepsin L regulates GCase abundance in dopaminergic neurons derived from a patient with GBA1-PD. Similar to the data obtained from microglia cell line and GD fibroblasts, treatment with SB 412515 in the control induced pluripotent stem cell\u2013dopaminergic (iPSC-dopaminergic) neurons derived from a healthy individual elevated both GCase and LIMP-2 protein levels (Figure 7A). Moreover, the level of pS129-α-synuclein, a modified form of α-synuclein that is associated with PD pathogenesis (73), was significantly reduced by the SB 412515 treatment, whereas the total α-synuclein levels were not significantly changed. Importantly, SB 412515did not significantly alter the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), β3-tubulin, or total cellular ubiquitinated proteins. As we observed in the HMC3 and GD fibroblast, cathepsin L protein level was increased by SB 412515 in the control iPSC-dopaminergic neurons (Figure 7A). Both intermediate and mature cathepsin L protein levels were increased by SB 412515 in the control iPSC-dopaminergic neurons (Figure 7A). Similar to the observed elevation in GCase protein levels following treatment with the cathepsin L inhibitor in healthy control-dopaminergic neurons (Figure 7A), cathepsin L inhibitor also resulted in a ~1.4-fold increase in in vitro GCase activity in dopaminergic neurons (Figure 7B). Having found that the chemical inhibitor of cathepsin L can increase GCase protein level in the iPSC-dopaminergic neurons, we next asked whether the SB 412515 could correct GCase level in a dopaminergic neuronal PD model of GCase-deficiency. To this end, we used iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons from a patient with GBA1-PD carrying a heterozygous GBA1-c.84dupG frameshift mutation, resulting in 50% reduction in GCase level (74). Inhibition of cathepsin L by SB 412515 increased both GCase and LIMP-2 levels in these neurons (Figure 7C), and the levels of pS129-α-synuclein were also significantly reduced by the SB 412515 treatment, while total α-synuclein levels were not changed. The levels of TH, β3-tubulin, lysosomal proton pump subunit ATP6V1D, or total cellular ubiquitinated proteins were not affected by the SB 412515 treatment (Figure 7C). Consistent with the observed elevation in GCase protein levels following treatment with the cathepsin L inhibitor in 84gg GBA1-dopaminergic neurons (Figure 7C), we found increased GCase activity upon cathepsin L inhibitor treatment (Figure 7D)."

Therefore, restoring GCase activity is expected to benefit patients who carry mutations in GBA1. In attempts to develop treatments for GBA1-associated diseases, several approaches have advanced to clinical trials, including a GCase chaperoning strategy with Ambroxol, which is in phase II clinical trial (NCT05287503), and gene therapy with AAV-WT GBA1 that is in phase 1/2a (NCT04127578). Since each therapeutic strategy has limitations, new approaches for effective treatment of patients with GCase deficiency are still necessary. Our data suggest a previously unexplored approach, to our knowledge, of increasing lysosomal GCase activity by inhibiting its degradation in the lysosome. We found that inhibition of cathepsin L, a lysosomal cysteine protease, leads to increased levels and activity of GCase by partially reducing its degradation in the lysosome."

Individual lysosomal cysteine proteases are thought to play redundant and specific functions in cells (44, 45, 75). Here we have shown that cathepsin L is crucial for regulating GCase abundance in the lysosome. Interestingly, although both cathepsin L and cathepsin B are ubiquitously expressed lysosomal cysteine proteases, cathepsin B does not appear to play a significant role in regulating GCase protein levels. Our previous study in cathepsin B\u2013deficient cells revealed no significant change in GCase protein levels (76), suggesting that the regulation of GCase abundance in lysosomes is primarily mediated by cathepsin L. However, our previous study suggested that cathepsin B promotes prosaposin processing to saposin C, an activator of GCase (76). Here, we also found that saposin C levels and the ratio of saposin C/prosaposin were increased in the cathepsin L\u2013KO cells (Figure 1A and Supplemental Figure 1A). While our data suggest that increased GCase activity in cathepsin L\u2013KO cells is primarily due to increased GCase protein levels, it is also possible that increased saposin C levels contribute to the increased activity. It will be of interest to examine the interplay of cathepsins B and L in regulating endogenous lysosomal GCase activity as part of future studies."

    "text": "Therefore, targeting cathepsin L\u2013mediated GCase degradation could offer some benefits to GBA1-deficient patients. However, previously reported phenotypes of cathepsin L\u2013KO mice, including hair loss, skin thickening, and bone and heart defects, raise concerns about adverse effects of cathepsin L inhibition (77\u201379). Therefore, it will be important to develop noncovalent and GCase-preferred cathepsin L inhibitors to minimize such adverse effects. Importantly, increasing lysosomal GCase stability using cathepsin L inhibitors could have synergistic effects with other therapeutic strategies, such as chemical chaperoning of GCase, AAV-mediated recombinant GCase delivery, or direct GCase activators. Another potential application of inhibiting GCase degradation would be in enzyme replacement therapy, an effective treatment for type 1 GD. This therapy involves i.v. infusions of recombinant human GCase to correct the GCase deficiency (80). However, the short half-life of the recombinant human GCase enzyme in blood poses a challenge to deliver active recombinant GCase to some target cells and organs, especially the bone (81). We propose that slowing GCase degradation during enzyme replacement therapy could increase the half-life of recombinant GCase and make it more effective. While the feasibility of cathepsin L as a therapeutic target is currently unknown, cathepsin L inhibition has been actively pursued as a potential treatment for COVID-19 (82\u201384). In this context, cathepsin L mediates cleavage of the S1 subunit of the coronavirus surface spike glycoprotein that is required for host entry and replication (85, 86)."

The target sequence of human GBA1-CRISP/Cas-9 construct is 5\u2032-GCGACGGATGGAGCTGAGTA-3\u2032. RNAi construct CTSL-RNAi #1 (TRCN0000318682), and CTSL-RNAi #2 (TRCN0000318611) were purchased from MilliporeSigma. HEK293-FT cells and KO cell lines were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen, 11668-019), according to the manufacture's instruction. HMC3 cell was purchased from ATCC (catalog CRL3304). HMC3 cells were maintained in EMEM (ATCC) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/treptomycin. Fibroblast cells derived from a from a female patient with Type 3 GD carrying homozygous GBA1 L444P mutation were obtained from Telethon Network of Genetic Biobank (cell line no. 20516), and fibroblast cells were maintained in DMEM with 15% FBS and 1% penicillin/treptomycin. All cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2. iPSC cell culture and dopaminergic neuron differentiation were performed as previously described (74). iPSCs (GBA1-c.84dupG, C14 clone) derived from skin fibroblasts of a patient with PD carrying a heterozygous GBA1-c.84dupG mutation has been previously described (74)."

Skin fibroblasts of a patient with PD (male) harboring GBA1 heterozygous 84GG mutation were reprogrammed into iPSCs through Northwestern University Stem Cell Core Facility, using Sendai virus\u2013based (SeV-based) delivery of Oct, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. A healthy control iPSC line was purchased from the NINDS Cell Line Repository at the Coriell Institute for Medical Research (ND34769). The iPSCs were maintained in mTeSR1 media (Stemcell Technologies, 85850) and passaged as small chunks every 6\u20138 days, depending on confluence. All iPSC lines have been tested for mycoplasma on a monthly basis for quality control. Differentiation of iPSCs toward dopaminergic neurons was conducted using a previously established protocol with minor modifications (88). iPSCs were plated as single cells and were treated with small molecules/ factors according to the original protocol. At day 13 of differentiation, cells were passaged en bloc (size of 1\u20132 mm) onto 10 cm culture dishes precoated with poly-d-lysine (PDL) (MilliporeSigma, P1149)/laminin (Invitrogen, 23017-015).
