    "text": "Introduction Following the second world symposium on pulmonary hypertension (PH) held in Evian, France, in 1998, PH has been classified into five major clinical groups [1]. Although the architecture of this classification was kept over subsequent world symposia and publications of guidelines, it was also continuously adapted in order to reflect the growing knowledge on the underlying aetiologies and pathologies [2\u20135]. Group 5 PH, characterised by unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms, summarises several conditions that involve a variety of distinct disorders, as outlined in the revised European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of PH. Each of these definitions is associated with largely unclear and multifactorial underlying pathologies [5]. The management of these patients is challenging as the number of patients in these groups is often small, not all individuals with certain underlying conditions are affected by PH and patients suffer from distinct symptoms due to different underlying diseases. Studies and clinical trials in these groups are largely lacking and mostly restricted to case series and registry reports, even though the worldwide burden of group 5 PH is estimated to be significant in terms of the prevalence of some associated diseases [5]. Group 5 PH encompasses six subgroups, including haematological disorders (inherited and acquired chronic haemolytic anaemia and chronic myeloproliferative disorders), systemic disorders (sarcoidosis, pulmonary Langerhans's cell histiocytosis and neurofibromatosis type 1), metabolic disorders (glycogen storage diseases and Gaucher disease), chronic renal failure with or without haemodialysis, pulmonary tumour thrombotic microangiopathy (PTTM) and fibrosing mediastinitis (table 1). As the exact underlying mechanisms of PH in these groups are not clear, the treatment should be focused on the underlying disease. Additionally, treatment of potential involved pathomechanisms should be evaluated, such as supplemental oxygen in hypoxaemia and tissue hypoxia, anticoagulation in thrombosis, revascularisation therapy in mechanical pulmonary artery obstructions, anti-inflammatory drug therapies in inflammatory diseases, and heart failure therapies in cardiomyopathies according to guidelines [6]."

Her past medical history included allergic asthma with concomitant allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, arterial hypertension and hypercholesterinaemia, all of them well controlled with medical treatment. The symptoms at initial presentation 8 years ago were dyspnoea and fatigue. After a diagnostic work-up, sarcoidosis was histologically confirmed in biopsies of the mediastinal lymph nodes. As lung function was preserved, no specific treatment at initial diagnosis had been started. In the further course of the disease, several cutaneous manifestations were diagnosed, which were treated locally by a dermatologist, with the last episode 2 years ago. For 2 years, the patient had experienced progressive dyspnoea at exercise (World Health Organization (WHO) functional class (FC) II) without other symptoms such as chest pain, palpitations or peripheral oedema. Because of new echocardiographic signs of PH, she was referred to our PH clinic at the University Hospital of Zurich in 2016 for further diagnostic work-up and treatment. The regular treatment at the time of presentation consisted of aspirin, losartan, hydrochlorthiazide, rosuvastatin and seretide."

Physical examination revealed no abnormalities except for one little cutaneous lesion at the left forearm. The ECG showed no pathologies with a normal axis and no signs of right heart hypertrophy. Lung function revealed reduced dynamic volumes (forced expiratory volume in 1 s 1.8 L (65%), forced vital capacity 2.6 L (70%) without a manifest restrictive pattern (total lung capacity 5.1 L (95%)) and a reduced diffusion capacity for CO (DLCO 68%). Blood cell count was normal except for a mild lymphopaenia; renal and hepatic function showed normal values, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was in the normal range (84 ng·L−1). Blood gas analysis showed normal oxygenation (PaO2 85 mmHg) without a relevant gas exchange disturbance (normal alveolar\u2013arterial gradient). Echocardiography revealed normal right and left heart function. A slightly elevated right ventricular/right atrial (RV/RA) gradient of 45 mmHg was noted without other indirect signs of PH. Six-minute walking distance was preserved (584 m), but showed a severe exercise-induced desaturation from 97 to 83% at end of exercise (Borg dyspnoea scale 3/10). Regarding sarcoidosis activity parameters, only neopterin was slightly elevated with 3.8 ng·L−1 (normal <2.5 ng·L−1), whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and serum soluble interleukin 2 receptor values were normal."

On computed tomograph pulmonary angiography (CTPA), in addition to the fibrosis, there were ill-defined centrilobular nodules and calcified mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy (figure 2a). Over the course of the disease, the patient had also undergone dual-energy CTPA, which elegantly demonstrated large perfusion deficits on the iodine map but no thromboembolic disease. These defects are likely a consequence of pulmonary vascular compression by the lymph-nodal enlargement. The presence of subtle centrilobular ground glass changes amongst the background fibrosis raises the possibility of underlying small vessel vasculopathy. In concordance with the echocardiography, there were no computed tomography (CT) features to suggest PH (figure 2b)."

    "text": "Background \u2013 epidemiology and pathophysiology Sarcoidosis-associated pulmonary hypertension (SAPH) has remained in group 5 of the current clinical classification because of its multifactorial pathogenesis and clinical appearance [5, 8]. It can be caused by different and overlapping mechanisms and its precise origin is still unknown. According to registry data, the incidence of SAPH is 5\u201320% in sarcoidosis and its prevalence reaches up to 74% in advanced stages listed for lung transplantation [9, 10]. The median time between the initial diagnosis of sarcoidosis and SAPH is 15 years, suggesting that SAPH is a complication of the advanced disease stage [11, 12, 13]. However, interestingly, a correlation between lung function impairment and pulmonary haemodynamics has not yet been shown. There is an important impact on survival with an 8-to-10-fold increase of mortality in SAPH versus sarcoidosis without PH and a 5-year survival rate of 59% [10, 14, 15]. In SAPH, complex interactions may occur between the pulmonary vasculature and the parenchymal, mediastinal and cardiovascular compartments. Therefore, elevation of pulmonary artery pressures can be induced directly by involvement of pulmonary vessels or indirectly by advanced lung parenchymal destruction or compressive mediastinal infiltration. The most common cause of SAPH is pulmonary fibrosis with a related destruction of the vascular bed and alveolar hypoxia with resulting hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction contributing to the development of PH. However, up to one fifth of patients with SAPH have no radiographic evidence of interstitial lung disease [16, 17]. In about 20% of SAPH patients, cardiomyopathy caused by left ventricular involvement of sarcoidosis can lead to development of post-capillary PH [10]. Less commonly, isolated pulmonary vasculopathy with granulomatous involvement of the pulmonary arteries and veins can lead to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) or pulmonary veno-occlusive-like disease. In addition, granulomatous mediastinal lymphadenopathy with compression of pulmonary vessels, chronic thromboembolic disease and liver involvement may contribute to PH in sarcoidosis patients."

    "text": "Pathology Granulomatous pulmonary vasculopathy may occur in all calibres of pulmonary vessels, but appears particularly compressive/obstructive in smaller calibres with thin vessel walls. Typical sarcoid granulomas are well defined and composed of epithelioid histiocytes with scattered giant cells (Langhans cells) and a peripheral lymphocytic rim. They lack any sign of necrosis, as compared to tuberculosis-type granulomas. Typically, they occur within the collagen-rich adventitia of pulmonary arteries, small airways and veins (figure 3). They are also found independently of the broncho-vascular bundles throughout the interstitial space, though more frequently next to the interlobular septa, where lymphatics and veins are passing through. This might explain why venous involvement is common in SAPH pathology and has been described in the past [15]. As stated above, venular and arteriolar remodelling is also observed independently of granulomas in SAPH and in this case appears more or less similar to the vascular lesions found in group 1 PH (PAH); plexiform lesions, however, are very unusual in SAPH and the possibility of independent concomitant disease should be at least considered. Interstitial lung fibrosis leading to late-stage SAPH may resemble atypical unusual interstitial pneumonia/idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and is usually distinguished by the distribution pattern of collagen-rich fibrosis. So-called fibroblastic foci, particularly aggressive myofibroblasts at the boundaries of progressive collagen deposition, are more common in the latter and less frequently seen in SAPH with interstitial fibrosis."

In addition to supportive measures such as oxygen supplementation and diuretic therapy, there are two main principles of treatment, namely anti-inflammatory and PAH-targeted therapy. As data is scarce, treatment should be discussed on an individual case-by-case basis and no PAH-specific treatment can be recommended over another. Careful evaluation is needed and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron emission tomography\u2013CT might support decision making by evaluation of mediastinal uptake as a sign of inflammatory disease activity favouring anti-inflammatory therapy [13]. Additionally, mechanical treatment by pulmonary vascular stenting might be an option in patients with pulmonary artery stenosis. In cases of insufficient treatment response or deterioration of lung function, early referral for lung transplantation is recommended."

According to registry data, half of patients with SCD reveal pulmonary complications and 6\u201310% of patients with SCD reveal PH with an equal distribution of pre- and post-capillary PH [20, 21]. As known from other groups, PH is also associated with increased mortality in SCD. Screening of SCD patients for PH using echocardiography is questionable, as tricuspid regurgitation velocity is increased in anaemia. However, echocardiography is helpful for diagnosing, treating and following-up symptomatic patients with left heart disease and to guide diagnostic right heart catheterisation in patients with suspected predominant pre-capillary PH [21\u201323]."

Within a week after treatment initiation, an episode of haematemesis occurred and gastric adenocarcinoma was diagnosed during immediate gastroscopy. Chest radiography showed marked cardiomegaly with dilatation of proximal pulmonary arteries and bilateral pleural effusions (figure 9). Due to clinical worsening with severe hypoxaemia, treated by high flow oxygen treatment, an escape chemotherapy (mFOLFOX regimen \u2013 fluorouracil, calcium folinate, oxaliplatin) was initiated before completion of tumour staging. Within days, the hypoxaemia alleviated, thus allowing for diagnostic laparoscopy, which did not reveal a metastatic spread. Accordingly, a neoadjuvant chemotherapy was launched (FLOT regimen \u2013 docetaxel, oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, leucovorin) and subsequent gastrectomy was performed. The patient's symptoms resolved completely within 2 months. Follow-up CTPA showed complete resolution of lung parenchymal abnormalities and vascular lesions with normalisation of the right ventricular size and main pulmonary artery calibre (figure 10). Retrospectively, we considered a PTTM the most probable cause of the PH. Follow-up after successful oncologic treatment and 10 cumulative months of PAH-specific medication showed an excellent clinical response without remaining dyspnoea (WHO FC 0\u2013I), normal echocardiography and NT-proBNP levels.

In particular, platelet-derived growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor signalling have been described during the process of tumour cell\u2013endothelial cell interaction [32, 33], both important pathways in the natural history of PAH. In addition, the osteopontin\u2013CD44 axis, which is well-known to promote growth and migration in cancer cells, has been shown to exert similar properties in adventitial fibroblasts of experimental hypoxic PH and to substantially contribute to pulmonary vascular remodelling in this setting [34]. Hence, the rather infrequent development of PH in the context of metastatic cancer might depend on a predisposition for PH with an additive effect of similar molecular pathways."

Those reports, however, suggest that the initiation of cancer therapy is of utmost importance [35, 36]. Furthermore, administration of PAH-targeted therapy and antiproliferative drugs, specifically tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, have been used to treat patients with PTTM. In most cases, patients did not survive >12 months [32, 37\u201341]."
