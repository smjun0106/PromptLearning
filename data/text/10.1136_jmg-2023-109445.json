    "text": "Background Pegunigalsidase alfa is a PEGylated α-galactosidase A enzyme replacement therapy. BALANCE (NCT02795676) assessed non-inferiority of pegunigalsidase alfa versus agalsidase beta in adults with Fabry disease with an annualised estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope more negative than −2 mL/min/1.73 m2/year who had received agalsidase beta for ≥1year. Methods Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive 1 mg/kg pegunigalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta every 2 weeks for 2 years. The primary efficacy analysis assessed non-inferiority based on median annualised eGFR slope differences between treatment arms. Results Seventy-seven patients received either pegunigalsidase alfa (n=52) or agalsidase beta (n=25).At baseline, mean (range) age was 44 (18\u201360) years, 47 (61%) patients were male, median eGFR was 74.5mL/min/1.73 m2 and median (range) eGFR slope was −7.3 (−30.5, 6.3) mL/ min/1.73 m2/year.At 2 years, the difference between median eGFR slopes was −0.36mL/min/1.73 m2/year, meeting the prespecified non-inferiority margin. Minimal changes were observed in lyso-Gb3 concentrations in both treatment arms at 2 years. Proportions of patients experiencing treatment-related adverse events and mild or moderate infusion-related reactions were similar in both groups, yet exposure-adjusted rates were 3.6-fold and 7.8-fold higher, respectively, with agalsidase beta than pegunigalsidase alfa.At the end of the study, neutralising antibodies were detected in 7 out of 47 (15%) pegunigalsidase alfa-treated patients and 6 out of 23 (26%) agalsidase beta-treated patients.There were no deaths. Conclusions Based on rate of eGFR decline over 2 years, pegunigalsidase alfa was non-inferior to agalsidase beta. Pegunigalsidase alfa had lower rates of treatment-emergent adverse events and mild or moderate infusion-related reactions."

    "text": "Fabry disease (FD; OMIM #301500) is a rare, progressive X-linked lysosomal disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the GLA gene leading to deficiency of α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) and associated accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3).1\u20135 FD involves many systems, including renal, cardiac, neurologic and cerebrovascular.6 Phenotypic variation is marked in heterozygous females with higher plasma α-Gal A activity, random X-linked inactivation and deficient cross-correction.7\u201311 At the time the BALANCE study was conducted, three FD treatment options were approved with varying availability by country, including two enzyme replacement therapies (ERTs; agalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta) and one oral pharmacological chaperone therapy (migalastat).12 13 Agalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta are ERT preparations with engineered α-Gal A, administered via intravenous infusion every 2 weeks (E2W) at 0.2 and 1mg/kg doses, respectively.12 In clinical trials, ERT reduced the rate of kidney function decline, improved cardiac structure, reduced neuropathic pain severity and improved gastrointestinal symptoms.14 15 Patients receiving agalsidase beta who initiated treatment at a younger age and with higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) benefited most; baseline glomerular sclerosis and uncontrolled proteinuria were indicators for poor prognosis.16 ERTs can lead to clinically relevant improvements in natural disease course, although disease progression occurs in some cases.17 Antidrug antibodies (ADAs) occur in up to 83% of patients with FD receiving agalsidase beta in clinical trials18 and are more common in males.19 In real-world studies, ADAs negatively impact biomarker response to ERT (less robust lyso-Gb3 reduction) and clinical outcomes12 19\u201322 and are associated with infusion-related reactions.23\u201327 Pegunigalsidase alfa, approved in the EU and the USA, is a novel PEGylated α-Gal A ERT with prolonged half-life, and designed to have reduced immunogenicity and potentially improved tolerability.13 28\u201330 It is chemically modified with 2 kDa homo-bifunctional polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules cross-linking two plant cell\u2013derived subunits of α-Gal A or bound to surface lysine residues by one end only,29 resulting in PEGylated, covalently bound 114 kDa homodimer enzyme. Potential masking of some immune epitopes by PEGylation29 may explain the lower immunogenicity.30 31 Comparing in vitro and in vivo properties of pegunigalsidase alfa versus agalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta demonstrated equivalent activity with longer in vivo plasma half-life, in vitro stability with plasma-like and lysosomal-like conditions, and different cellular uptake routes.29 Elimination plasma half-life is approximately 90\u2013110 min for agalsidase alfa and 80\u2013120 min for agalsidase beta.18 32 Pegunigalsidase alfa has an elimination half-life of ~80 hours, effective Gb3 clearance from renal tissue and a favourable safety profile up to 12 months.30 33 The phase III BALANCE study (NCT02795676) is the first randomised, double-blind, active-control, head-to-head clinical trial of ERTs in FD and is the first study to directly evaluate efficacy, safety and tolerability of pegunigalsidase alfa versus agalsidase beta in adult patients with previous agalsidase beta treatment and deteriorating renal function."

This difference in pre-enrolment and on-study slope could have resulted from differences in how historical and on-study creatinine values were derived (site-specific vs centralised, non-uniform vs predefined time intervals, variable vs predefined number of assessments, different vs same laboratory methodology). Of note, patients were managed before enrolment by standards of care that may have varied across the 29 study centres in 12 countries. Renal function in both arms stabilised, despite declining renal function at baseline and the unchanged agalsidase beta regimen. Nonetheless, baseline kidney function was equivalent between arms, supporting the validity of the randomisation. Medication adjustments would likely not affect results, because the use of ACEi/ ARBs remained stable in both arms. Another possible explanation for this observation is the Hawthorne effect, a known phenomenon whereby clinical study participants benefit by being more closely observed than with standard care.42 Median plasma lyso-Gb3 remained stable over the 2-year study in both treatment arms. As expected, sex stratification revealed that lyso-Gb3 concentrations were higher in males. Further post hoc analysis of outliers suggests baseline ADAs and UPCR >1 g/g may relate to changes in lyso-Gb3; these patients were slightly over-represented in the pegunigalsidase alfa arm. Generally, the clinical significance of the magnitude of lyso-Gb3 changes in both groups should be interpreted with caution."

No deaths were reported. Two patients on pegunigalsidase alfa withdrew due to AEs; one hypersensitivity reaction and the other not treatment-related."

The proportion of ADA-positive patients decreased slightly in both arms, from 35% at baseline to 23% at study end with pegunigalsidase alfa and from 32% to 26% with agalsidase beta. The proportion of patients with neutralising antibodies declined with pegunigalsidase alfa, from 33% to 15% compared with a change from 28% to 26% with agalsidase beta. Baseline reactivity to pegunigalsidase alfa is explained by cross-reactivity to the enzyme components of the amino acid sequence shared between pegunigalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta.31 Recent studies show that in some patients, pre-existing ADAs against agalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta have less affinity and enzymatic inhibitory effects against pegunigalsidase alfa31; however, it is currently not possible to predict which ADA-positive patients may benefit from ERT switch and additional analysis needs to be performed. In BALANCE, only 3 patients per arm (6% (3/52) with pegunigalsidase alfa; 12% (3/25) with agalsidase beta) showed treatment-induced de novo ADAs, all with long-term agalsidase beta exposure. These rates are lower than what has been described in trials of naïve patients, as de novo ADAs typically occur in the first months of ERT initiation. For example, treatment-induced ADAs developed in 19% of naïve patients treated with pegunigalsidase alfa30 and 83% of naïve patients receiving agalsidase beta.18 Direct comparison of ADA incidence across trials is also challenging due to the use of different ADA assays. Overall, these ADA findings should be interpreted with caution and with consideration of the patients' long-term ERT exposure."

Differences between arms in ADAs and infusion-related reactions could have been underestimated because patients were already treated with agalsidase beta for an average of 6 years, and these occur most commonly in the first years of treatment. Due to the methodological challenges of interpretation, the current analysis does not compare the level of ADAs (titres) between arms and is limited to describing the proportion and trends of patients with ADAs within arms over time. Furthermore, FD is a heterogeneous disease with remaining unmet needs; the availability of new therapies can contribute to personalising patient care and potentially establishing combination regimens.43\u201345 BALANCE is the first clinical trial in FD to be conducted with a double-blind, active-control design. Pegunigalsidase alfa was comparable to agalsidase beta based on annualised eGFR slope, an accepted surrogate for progression to end-stage kidney disease. Results demonstrated the potential for improved tolerability with less infusion-related reactions in some patients. Further detailed analysis of pegunigalsidase alfa immunogenicity is warranted. Most patients who completed the study (96%) enrolled in the open-label extension study for up to 7 years of pegunigalsidase alfa treatment. Pegunigalsidase alfa is approved in the EU and the USA, providing an important new treatment option for patients with FD."
