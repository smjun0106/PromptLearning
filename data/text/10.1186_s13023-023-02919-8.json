Among the selected patients who started home therapy before enrollment, the average number of missed home-based infusions was 0.7 (1.3) in cohort A and 3.8 (6.4) in cohort B with no return to the hospital setting. Irrespective of the treatment location, 3 prior ADRs per cohort were reported. The majority of patients preferred home-based infusions (cohort A: 96.9%; cohort B: 100%): the main reason was attributed to treatment convenience (cohort A: 81.3%; cohort B: 83.3%). Despite the underlying conditions, most patients self-evaluated their health as \"good\" (cohort A: 50%; cohort B: 83.3%)."

Each disorder is due to an individual enzyme deficiency [7], with Pompe disease and mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) caused by deficiency of α-glucosidase and α-L-iduronidase, respectively.

Although disease progression can be observed in both Pompe disease and MPS in patients with good treatment adherence, it tends to be much more rapid in patients without treatment or with poor treatment compliance [10\u201312]. Case reports of rapid cessation of ERT therapy suggested that prolonged interruptions cause not only a loss of the beneficial effects of therapy but also a significant worsening of clinical status [13\u201315].

In this study, ~ 90% of the enrolled population started ERT administration in a homecare setting prior to enrollment and were on home therapy for 14.6 (7.5) months in cohort A and 69.5 (40.4) months in cohort B. In both groups, laboratory parameters (not shown), vital signs (not shown) and physical examination (not shown) were within the limits of normal clinical range with minimal clinically relevant anomalies, indicating that patients were stable at screening, irrespective of the treatment location (home vs. hospital). Safety data presented from the Italian cohorts exhibited uneventful infusions in a hospital setting with acceptable tolerability profile recommending the study patients as ideal candidates for complete transitioning to home-based treatment. Overall, as opposed to hospital-based infusion, the incidence of prior ADRs was lower on homecare infusions with good safety profile. Seriousness criteria and intensity of ADRs are the key factors that should be considered for safety. ADRs occurring in a homecare setting were not reported in any of the patients in cohort A and only 1 patient in cohort B, limited to 2 episodes of non-serious, mild \"Fever\". None of the reported ADRs warranted urgent medical intervention. The current findings are consistent with previous experiments on home-based infusion of ERT in MPS I patients [21] and Pompe disease [22], indicating that the rate of ADRs during home therapy was quite low with mild or moderate intensity and can be readily managed without treatment interruption. Precisely, the data from this interim analysis suggest that in patients with Pompe disease and MPS I, home-based ERT infusions are equivalently safe as hospital-based ERT infusions."

In this study, transition to home infusion therapy was due to COVID-19, traveling reasons, upon patients' request and other reasons (i.e., For improvement in the subject's stature and medical considerations). Approximately 25% of patients had peripheral venous access or a totally implanted venous access device in situ at home. This study speculated that the majority of patients with Pompe disease and MPS I were more comfortable with a home-based infusion setting as the patients were able to perform an IV dilution independently with no change in the concentration of the dilution throughout the treatment period and adhered to the recommended dosage regimen of alglucosidase alfa [25] and laronidase [26]. In the present study, treatment compliance was measured by the number of missed ERT infusions as defined by Linthorst et al. [27] and the home infusion program positively influenced infusion compliance by reducing the number of therapy interruptions. Apparently, no instances of relapse into hospital infusion settings were observed. Having the derived results as evidence, we can argue that improved ERT compliance will inevitably have a positive impact on treatment outcomes over the long term."

The advantage of using data obtained from non-interventional studies implies obtaining data in a normal clinical setting under real-life conditions, which are more representative of the study population of interest and the clinical outcomes under observation. Despite the aforementioned strengths, there are potential limitations worth discussion. The main limitations of this interim analysis are attributed to its observational retrospective nature that may involve patient selection bias, incomplete or missing data and lack of internal validity (no control group), difficulty in interpreting or verifying documented information, and variability between patients in the quality of documentation. Furthermore, treatment satisfaction assessed through patient responses are subjective and may involve a risk of recall bias, hence some outcomes might not be accurate from a medical perspective. Enrolled patients were already in a home infusion setting prior to enrollment, and the preference for home therapy over hospital therapy by experienced person may differ from the judgment of a participant new to treatment. Lack of in-depth investigations that encompasses bigger cohort size or compare the attitudes between young and adult patients could have added a new opinion to treatment preference."

Based on our real-world data retrospective interim analysis of the HomERT program, we found no evidence that the safety of laronidase and alglucosidase alfa substantially change with home infusion. This proved that for Pompe disease and MPS I, home-based ERT infusion is equally safe as hospital-based infusion, feasible and might alleviate the burden of life-long intravenous treatment in these patients."
