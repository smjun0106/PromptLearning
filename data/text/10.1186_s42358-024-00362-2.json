It is a pan-ethnic X-linked disease with an estimated birth incidence of 1 per 117,000 in the general population, and 1 per 40,000 male live births [8, 36, 37]. FD is caused by deficient or absent lysosomal α-galactosidase A (α-GAL) activity. This enzyme is encoded by the GLA gene located on the long arm of the X chromosome. More than 1000 GLA pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants have been described to date [8, 38]. α-GAL catalyzes the removal of terminal galactose groups from substrates such as globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and glycoproteins [39]. Thus, the main metabolic consequence of α-GAL deficiency is the accumulation of Gb3 and its deacylated form globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) in multiple cells, especially in the vascular endothelium, vascular smooth muscle cells, cardiomyocytes, podocytes, autonomic ganglia, and conduction fibers [38\u201341]."

Treatment with ERT is recommended for both adults and children, but the age at which it is authorized varies according to the product and the approval specific to each country. Chaperone therapy stabilizes some misfolded forms of αGAL, which facilitates their trafficking to lysosomes, prolongs their half-life and enhances their catalytic activity [66, 67]. Treatment with migalastat is intended for patients who are 12 years of age or older, have amenable GLA gene variants, and have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Amenability refers to the ability of the α-GAL encoded by amenable variants to respond to chaperone therapy in vitro with an increase in its activity.
