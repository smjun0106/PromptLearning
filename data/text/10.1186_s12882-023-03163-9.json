Remission of proteinuria and improvement of hypoalbuminemia would do good to reduction of ascites. On the other hand, whether prednisone and MMF would play a role in lowering portal pressure which was thought to be another important cause of ascites? Recent studies have confirmed glucocorticoid as the recommended therapy in severe alcoholic hepatitis and mycophenolate mofetil as first-line treatment of autoimmune hepatitis for their inhibition effect on liver immune response [23, 24]. Unfortunately, we had not completed portal pressure measurement before treatment and we would follow up the case for more evidence."

    "text": "Here we presented a case of 35-year-old man suffering from GD1 with hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, bone destruction, myelofibrosis and MPGN. He received the treatment of oral glucocorticoid and MMF, which improved the liver and renal outcomes. The case provided us more therapeutic strategies for the GD1 patients lost to ERT therapy according to their characteristic clinical manifestations. Therapy of prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil may be an optional choice for patients with Gaucher disease who have no opportunity to use enzyme treatment."
