Pseudo-Gaucher cells are macrophages scavenging membrane glycolipids in the setting of high cell turnover, and they have been described in various conditions, such as thalassemia. Thalassemias are a group of inherited disorders characterized by a decreased production of globin chains of haemoglobin and are widely heterogeneous, both genetically and clinically.

    "text": "A 56-year-old female was under investigation due to a thoracic vertebra fracture, osteolytic lesions and osteoporosis under treatment with denosumab. A physical examination revealed only splenomegaly. A skeletal survey with a bone scan was positive for a diffused increased radioisotope uptake and an FDG PET-CT revealed a diffused FDG radiotracer uptake, suggesting the presence of a hematological condition such as multiple myeloma/low grade lymphoma or other benign conditions. A spinal computed tomography scan (CT) was also performed, confirming the presence of bone lesions and of a thoracic vertebra fracture. A bone marrow biopsy was performed in order to investigate the presence of multiple myeloma and revealed a medium infiltration (≤20% of the bone marrow cellular population) with Gaucher-like cells [PGM1+ (CD68 antibody), lysozyme+, PAS + (Periodic acid\u2014Shiff stain)], suggesting the possible diagnosis of a Lysosomal Storage Disease (LSD); the erythroid lineage was hyperplastic, but no monoclonal plasmatocytes were identified (3% polyclonal plasmatocytes). In parallel, further investigations were carried out. Peripheral blood testing for bcr-abl and JAK2V617F mutations was negative, serum electrophoresis for monoclonal band was negative, serum and urine immunofixation were negative, urine testing for Bence jones proteins was also negative, serum free κ chains were 8.95 mg/L (normal reference values: 3.3\u201319.4), free λ chains were 8.83 mg/L (normal reference values: 5.71\u201326.3), free κ/λ ratio 1.01, serum creatinine was 0.51 mg/dL (normal reference values: 0.51\u20130.95), serum calcium was 9.7 mg/dL (normal reference values: 8.6\u201310.2), and β2 microglobulin was 1.66 mg/dL (normal reference values: 0.97\u20132.64). Serum immunoglobulins were measured within normal reference values. The complete blood count showed Hb of 10.5 g/dL, MCV of 59.5 fL, MCH of 18.8 pg, WBC count of 7.90 × 103/uL, and PLT count of 180 × 103/uL. Serum ferritin was 119 ng/mL and the Hb HPLC electrophoresis showed HbA2 6.5%, HbA 69.2% and HbF 17.5%, findings leading to the diagnosis of thalassemia intermedia. Genotype characterization revealed the presence of the -101 (C>t) beta+ (silent) mutation in compound heterozygosity with the Codon 39 (C>T);CAG(Gln)->TAG (stop codon) beta0 (HGVS name: c.[-151C>T];[118C>T] Reference Sequence NM_000518.5. Additionally, the serum chitotriosidase measurement was 52 nmol (within normal reference values) and at the tandem mass spectrometry from dried blood spot, the quantitative measurement of lyso-GL-1 was 10.9 ng/mL (below the cutoff value of 14 ng/mL), and the glucocerebrosidase and acid sphingomyelinase activities of the patient were above the cut-off value. Taking all the above together, Gaucher and Niemann-Pick diseases were considered unlikely diagnoses for the patient (therefore no molecular testing was performed), while the diagnosis of TI was established."

This hypothesis could lead to more investigation and may add more information to the puzzle of pathogenesis of thalassemia bone disease. For example, it would be interesting to study the cytokines network profile and the bone disease status in a population of thalassemia patients with no deposits of Gaucher-like cells in hematopoietic tissues in comparison with a population of thalassemia patients with presence of Gaucher-like cells in such tissues. Unfortunately, our study has several limitations and cannot address these issues; the generalizability of our findings should be made with caution since we have included only two cases. In this context, no robust statistical analyses with adequate statistical power could be made in order to reach firm conclusions.

    "text": "Gaucher-like cells have been described in various conditions with high cell turnover, such as in major and intermedia thalassemia. The presence of Gaucher-like cells probably reflects the increased load of leukocyte membrane-derived glucosylceramide in macrophages. The normal mechanisms/pathways for its removal may be saturated and overloaded, resulting in an acquired phenotype resembling enzyme deficiency. The sheet-like pattern of Gaucher-like cells may obscure the underlying primary pathology causing diagnostic difficulties, so all involved professionals should include this knowledge in their differential diagnosis."
