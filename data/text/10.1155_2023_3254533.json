    "text": "Gaucher disease is one of the most common lysosomal diseases [1]. It is characterized by a defciency of acid β glucosidase that impairs glucosylceramide's catabolism, leading to glycolipid accumulation. Gaucher cells are seen in most tissues, but the spleen, liver, and bone marrow are some of the most afected. Consequently, patients with GD manifest visceromegaly, cytopenia, and diverse skeletal lesions [2, 3]. Skeletal manifestations are the primary cause of pain, disability, and reduced quality of life in patients with Gaucher disease. GD afects the bone marrow and mineralized components of the bone. Changes include bone marrow infltration, modeling, and bone remodeling, resulting in osteopenia-osteoporosis, cortical thinning, lytic lesions, osteonecrosis, and fragility fractures [4\u20136]. Our study will focus on bone changes in our patients diagnosed with GD."

For pediatric patients, specifc signed ICF parental consent has also been performed. We have completed the study-described activities at our Gaucher Unit, the only metabolic center in Albania, next to the Pediatric Department at Mother Teresa Hospital. Te scientifc research data were obtained from 2015-2016 (frst baseline evaluations) to 20202021 (follow-up-year 5). Tese patients have been followed up minimally for six years and further. At the start (baseline evaluations), we had 8 children and 16 adult subjects. Te average age was 28.7 years ± 16.5 SD. Te maximum age was 72 years old, and the minimum age was 7 years old. In the beginning, all patients started therapy with taliglucerase alfa (24 patients), and two of them switched to velaglucerase alfa because one patient presented adverse events and the other changed due to administrative issues. Before baseline, 12 patients were under therapy with imiglucerase at variable times (Figure 1). Te most frequent genotype (19 patients) was p. Asn409Ser: p. His294Gln/pAsp448His or N370 S: H255Q/D 409H according to old nomenclature (Table 1). Te mean dosage of taliglucerase alfa during the study was approximately 45 UI/kg. Switched patients to velaglucerase alfa have been at the exact dosage as before. We have performed for each patient a plain X-ray of the long bones and spine (baseline), an MRI of the abdomen and pelvis (every year), DEXA for L1-L4 and the right and left hip (every year), lab analyses (every year), and a bone pain assessment (every year). All radiological images obtained were interpreted by one radiologist with longtime experience in bone assessment of GD patients. In this study, we are focused only on bone changes. Te main topics of interest were as follows: (1) Evaluation of skeletal manifestations: For each patient, we have evaluated X-ray and MRI images. Te analyses included all 24 patients' data and images at baseline. Two patients with bone crises and severe bone changes, such as compressive fractures and vertebral osteonecrosis, left the country after baseline. Tey were brother and sister, respectively, 43 and 45 years old, and both were splenectomized. We have presented a lateral X-ray of the spine and an MRI of the same patient (brother). It was noticed that there was osteonecrosis of vertebral bodies L3 and L4 and a compressive fracture of T12 (Figure 2). Two other patients left the study during year three (FU3). One left the country, and the other had a severe adverse event. He refused to continue the therapy even though we proposed switching him to another ERT alternative."

Our frst goal was to fnd the most frequent skeletal manifestations in our group of patients. We have analyzed the radiological data for every patient. Te most common fnding at baseline was a reduction of tibial femoral space (Figure 4). Two of our patients who presented with bone crises left the study. Tey both (siblings) presented osteonecrosis and compressive fracture of vertebrae (Figure 2). Te tibial femoral space reduction fnding was unexpected to us as the most common radiological fnding in our patients. We thought Erlenmeyer fask deformity could have been one of the most frequent fndings, but in our group, the result was only 28%. Erlenmeyer fask deformity occurs before puberty, develops progressively, and is present in 80% of adults with Gaucher disease [7]. Lytic lesions are also very frequent in GD patients. Te bone has a \"worm-eaten\" aspect with a radiologically rarefed cortex and dentate endosteum [7]. We found only six patients with osteolytic-lucent lesions (6%). Osteonecrosis remains the most relevant and invalidating skeletal manifestation secondary to bone infarction. Te most afected areas are the femoral head, proximal humerus, and vertebral bodies [8]. Once established, it is irreversible [9]. In our study, we found osteonecrosis in 36% of our patients, the second most frequent fnding in our group of patients. At baseline, we had three patients (12%) who presented with bone crises, but two of them left the study. A bone crisis is an acute episode of severe pain with periosteal elevation on radiographs that may occur in patients with mild or severe disease. Of a total of 2004 patients enrolled in the International Gaucher Group registry from 1991 to 2001, between 76% and 94% of those with GD type 1 had a radiological manifestation of bone disease, including marrow infltration, Erlenmeyer fask deformity, or osteonecrosis [7]."

Te debilitation may last over three days, usually requiring immobilization and narcotics for pain relief [11]. Bone crises are often followed by necrosis and fractures [12]. Metabolic stress, such as pregnancy, may trigger bone crises [12\u201314]. Bone crises in GD may occasionally be confused with osteomyelitis [15]. One of our patients was diagnosed with GD after hospitalization in the infectious disease ward. He had a prolonged fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone crises. Initially suspected for osteomyelitis, but after bone marrow aspiration, Gaucher cells were noticed. Tis patient showed a dramatic reduction 4 Journal of Osteoporosis in the bone pain scale over the course of six years (see the black arrow in Figure 3). At the end of the study, his bone pain scale was 4. Of the other 14 patients who presented with bone pain at baseline, at the end of the study, four patients had only mild pain (pain scale � 2), eight patients had minimal bone pain (pain scale � 1), and two patients had no bone pain (pain scale � 0). Another element distinguishing a bone crisis from osteomyelitis is the absence of a left shift in the white cells and negative blood cultures [16]. Two other siblings who presented with bone crises are brother and sister, both splenectomized. Splenectomy, which was frequently carried out in GD patients to control Journal of Osteoporosis 5 thrombocytopenia, is thought to exacerbate the risk of osteonecrosis [17\u201319]. Splenectomized patients have more infammatory activity and severe bone disease than nonsplenectomized patients [17]. Tere is an ongoing debate between relational splenectomy and osteonecrosis. Actually, it is considered a causal relationship [20]. Terefore, splenectomy should be avoided to shun the development of osteonecrosis [21]."

In our groups, two factors were excluded: dosage and adherence were adequate, and splenectomized patients left the study; the most critical factor remains the time of diagnosis which was variable from months to years in our patients. Ultimately, we would like to emphasize that the cornerstone of bone health in Gaucher patients remains early diagnosis and adequate treatment in nonsplenectomized individuals."
