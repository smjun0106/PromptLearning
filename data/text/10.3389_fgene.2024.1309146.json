    "text": "Broadly, there are two categories based on age of onset and symptomatology: classic infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) and late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD). IOPD is the most severe and rapidly progressive form of Pompe disease. Patients present with cardiomyopathy in the first year of life, and without treatment, fatal cardiorespiratory failure ensues with death in the first 1\u20132 years of life. Over the last few decades, prognoses have improved dramatically with the advent of newborn screening for Pompe disease and prompt initiation of treatment, preferably before the onset of severe signs and symptoms of the disease (Kishnani et al., 2021; Huggins et al., 2022). In contrast, LOPD includes cases of Pompe disease in which the age ofonset is after 12 months, as well as those in which the age of onset is before 12 months who do not develop cardiomyopathy in the first year of life. Patients with LOPD experience progressive weakness in skeletal muscles including the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles, and consequently, respiratory failure remains the principal cause of death in LOPD (Toscano et al., 2019; Dimachkie et al., 2022)."

    "text": "Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase alfa was approved in 2006 as the first treatment for Pompe disease. Administering exogenous recombinant human GAA provides patients with an alternate means of cleaving glycogen, thus reducing accumulation and slowing disease progression. In IOPD and LOPD populations, ERT has remarkably improved both survival and quality of life (Schoser et al., 2017). For many years after its approval, alglucosidase alfa remained the standard of care for patients with Pompe disease. However, many patients on alglucosidase alfa infusions plateau or decline while on treatment, an indication that there remained an unmet need in the management of Pompe disease. This disease progression despite treatment has been partly attributed to suboptimal uptake of ERT into skeletal muscle (Diaz-Manera et al., 2021; Dimachkie et al., 2022)."

Avalglucosidase alfa has ~15-fold more bis-mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) residues per enzyme molecule than alglucosidase alfa. This enhances uptake and trafficking to the lysosome via the cation independent M6P receptor, resulting in increased delivery, improved glycogen clearance, and better outcomes compared to alglucosidase alfa. In preclinical models, avalglucosidase alfa exhibited as much as five-times greater glycogen clearance compared to an equivalent dose of alglucosidase alfa (Zhu et al., 2009; Kishnani et al., 2021; Sanofi Genzyme, 2021)."

This higher dose has also previously been shown in clinical trials (Mini COMET) to be safe and beneficial for patients with IOPD who showed clinical decline or a suboptimal response to alglucosidase alfa. Given the safety and efficacy ofhigher dosages in the IOPD population, some patients with LOPD who continued to decline despite 20 mg/kg q2w of avalglucosidase or were previously on 40 mg/kg/week of alglucosidase alfa were treated with 40 mg/kg q2w in this study.

Moreover, the switch data has been mostly limited to patients switching after relatively short durations of alglucosidase alfa; switch data from long-term ERT-experienced patients is scarce (Diaz-Manera et al., 2021; Dimachkie et al., 2022). Specifically, the COMET trial included n = 49 patients who switched after 49 weeks on alglucosidase alfa, and Dimachkie et al., 2022 included n = 10 patients who switched after 0.9\u20137 years and met criteria for inclusion.

The Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) was conducted to measure walking endurance per American Thoracic Society guidelines (ATS Committee on Proficiency Standards for Clinical Pulmonary Function Laboratories, 2002). Percent of predicted distance was calculated in accordance with norms established for age, gender, and height (Enright and Sherrill, 1998; Li et al., 2007). The Gait, Stairs, Gower, Chair (GSGC) test was used to measure motor function as previously described (Angelini et al., 2012; Khan et al., 2020a); GSGC scores range from 4 to 27, with a score of 4 indicating normal function. Patients were categorized into three degrees of impairment based on their GSGC score prior to the switch: mild (4\u201311), moderate (12\u201319), or severe (20\u201327). The Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-88) was used to test motor skills, with scores ranging from 0% to 100%, with 100% indicating normal function, which should be achieved by 5 years of age in those with typical function (Russell et al., 1989). The Quick Motor Function Test (QMFT), developed from the GMFM and validated in Pompe disease, has scores ranging from 0\u201364 with a score of 64 indicating normal function (van Capelle et al., 2012). Two subtests on the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency Second Edition (BOT-2) were utilized: running speed and agility (subtest 6) and strength (subtest 8) (Deitz et al., 2007). For the patient who was non-ambulatory, the 9Hole Peg Test (9-HPT) was used to measure hand dexterity (Wang et al., 2015), and lateral (key) pinch was used to assess strength as previously described (Paschall et al., 2021)."

She was diagnosed at age 21 months and retrospectively reported symptom onset within the first year of life without cardiomyopathy. Her initial symptoms were low tone, decreased head control, and delayed achievement of motor milestones. From a motor standpoint, she was able to independently drive her motorized wheelchair using a joystick at her most recent assessment, but she has been dependent for all functional mobility since 3 years of age and requires full-time care. She was initially managed with nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation but progressed to tracheostomy tube and ventilator dependence by age 4. Her past medical history is also significant for T4-sacral posterior spinal fusion surgery, oral-maxillary reconstructive surgery, history of fractures secondary to severe osteoporosis, and severe recurrent kidney stones secondary to poor water intake. She received alglucosidase alfa infusions for 19 years, up to a maximum dose of 40 mg/kg q1w. Due to a combination of lack of response to alglucosidase, infusion-associated reactions (full-body rash, emotional difficulties, myalgias, nausea, fatigue), and prolonged infusion time (7\u20137.5 h), she switched to avalglucosidase alfa at 40 mg/kg q2w. From her perspective, she reported improvements on avalglucosidase that far outweigh the minimal, if any, improvements that she noted on alglucosidase alfa."

The treatment has been lifesaving, but many patients on alglucosidase alfa infusions continue to decline while on treatment and require increased dosages, an indication that there remained an unmet need in the management of Pompe disease (Khan et al., 2020b; Diaz-Manera et al., 2021; Dimachkie et al., 2022). Second-generation ERT with avalglucosidase alfa was designed to exhibit enhanced uptake in target cells, thereby improving clinical response. Over the last few years, several studies have provided evidence of improved outcomes with avalglucosidase, though these studies used strict inclusion criteria and focused primarily on treatment-naïve patients. The COMET trial included n = 49 patients who switched after just 49 weeks on alglucosidase alfa, and Dimachkie et al., 2022 included n = 10 patients who switched after 0.9\u20137 years (Diaz-Manera et al., 2021; Kishnani et al., 2021; Dimachkie et al., 2022). This study describes real-world experiences in patients with LOPD, including n = 8 on alglucosidase alfa for more than 3 years, n = 7 for more than 5 years.

Unfortunately, without a true established MCIC for upright FVC in Pompe disease, interpretation of these changes is challenging. PFT data was limited, and patient 11 in particular only had two data values and no true historical baseline was able to be established for her. Notably, patient 5, the one patient with a decline in FVC, experienced an early improvement in percent predicted FVC from 91% to 97%, recorded around 18 months after switching. This improvement persisted at 28 months after the switch. However, the next set of PFTs at 54 months post-switch showed a decline, which progressed for the rest of her treatment history arriving at her most recent value of83%. Her supine values followed a similar trend, decreasing from 67% pre-switch to 47% at most recent evaluation. Upon chart review, no direct cause for this decline could be identified. Despite worsening in PFTs, patient 5 did show improvement in laboratory markers and PT assessments."

There were statistically significant improvements in comfortable and fast gait speed, while supine-to-stand (Gowers) and sit-to-stand (Chair) showed trends toward improvement that were not statistically significant. For gait speed, there were meaningful clinical improvements or stability for all but one patient at all time points after the switch. Gait speed is associated with various outcomes and functional categories (Middleton et al., 2015), thus stability or improvement in speed is important for functional capacity. A speed below 0.8 m/s is clinically significant, as it indicates that the patient may be categorized functionally as a limited community ambulator, while speeds below 0.42 m/s indicate that they are more likely a household only ambulator (Perry et al., 1995). Patients with severe functional impairments had the slowest walking speeds, yet one moved from the household-only ambulator category to limited-community ambulator (P6). The two patients in the moderately impaired group (P2, P5) had gait speeds between the mild and severe groups, and both made gains which placed them more firmly in the community ambulator category. All of the mildly impaired patients had gait speeds placing them in the community ambulator group, and they remained stable or improved."

    "text": "Limitations of this study include its relatively small cohort (n = 15) and short follow-up period. Many of the patients did not complete all of the evaluations used therein, and consequently some draw upon limited amounts of data. For instance, longitudinal PRO outcomes were only available in n = 4 patients; this was largely due to a lack of consistent data obtainable during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the selection of patients took place via convenience sampling, utilizing patients at the Duke metabolic clinic who met the inclusion criteria of switching ERT regimens. While this sample included a variety of patients, it may not be statistically representative of the general population of patients with LOPD. Despite thorough and comprehensive review of patient charts for the abstraction of data, it is possible that some data was missing from the chart or otherwise unavailable for use in this study. Future studies should be oriented toward substantiating these findings across a larger cohort of patients and with stricter control of confounding variables. The short follow-up periods resulted in data from only a few follow-up visits after the switch. This was especially apparent with patient 16, who had PT follow up only at 72-days post-switch. Continued follow-up is necessary to fully understand how patients are faring. This study also applied the MCID from other chronic pulmonary diseases to FVC results in LOPD, a common but imperfect practice that may not adequately reflect the pathological process in Pompe disease (Lachmann and Schoser, 2013). Finally, it should be noted that many of the PT evaluations were performed by different PTs. Although all examiners were experienced with Pompe disease, some discrepancies between scores, especially QMFT, were seen between different evaluators, reflecting the potentially decreased inter-rater reliability in a real-world clinical setting compared to a research setting."

A subset of patients with particularly severe manifestations appeared to show more persistent decline. Stabilization already represents a muchimproved outcome compared to the well-documented natural history of progressive decline in LOPD, but many patients in this cohort also showed tangible improvements after the switch (Hagemans et al., 2005; Winkel et al., 2005; Dimachkie et al., 2022). Overall, stabilization or improvement was seen across several different outcome metrics, including laboratory markers (n = 15/15), PT evaluations (n = 8/ 12 in 6MWT, n = 9/12 in GSGC, n = 11/12 in gait speed, and 7/ 12 in QMFT), PFTs (n = 4/7), and PROs (n = 3/4 in physical function or n = 4/4 in dyspnea, fatigue, and back pain). This study presents additional evidence that switching from alglucosidase to avalglucosidase may be associated with improved outcomes in a subset of patients with LOPD."
