    "text": "Developing vehicles that efficiently deliver genes throughout the human central nervous system (CNS) will broaden the range of treatable genetic diseases. We engineered an AAV capsid, BI-hTFR1, that binds human Transferrin Receptor (TfR1), a protein expressed on the blood-brain barrier (BBB). BI-hTFR1 was actively transported across a human brain endothelial cell layer and, relative to AAV9, provided 40\u201350 times greater reporter expression in the CNS of human TFRC knock-in mice. The enhanced tropism was CNS-specific and absent in wild type mice. When used to deliver GBA1, mutations of which cause Gaucher disease and are linked to Parkinson's disease, BI-hTFR1 substantially increased brain and cerebrospinal fluid glucocerebrosidase activity compared to AAV9. These findings establish BI-hTFR1 as a promising vector for human CNS gene therapy."

    "text": "A critical challenge in the development of more efficient delivery vectors for gene therapy is engineering vectors with known mechanisms of action (MOAs) relevant to human patients. Conventional approaches to engineering vectors such as adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) with enhanced tropisms have largely relied on capsid library selections in animals. These selections have been used by numerous groups over the past two decades because they can be successful without requiring prior knowledge of an MOA (1\u20137). However, vectors selected in animals mostly have not translated across preclinical models. Despite extensive searches, AAV capsids with clear translational potential and known MOAs for entering the CNS have not yet been described. Here, we approached this challenge from a different perspective and selected AAV capsids first for a specific MOA, that is binding to the human Transferrin Receptor (TfR1), and showed that one of these capsids crossed the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and mediated efficient gene delivery throughout the CNS."

We first screened 7-mer-modified AAV9 capsid libraries for their ability to bind to human TfR1 in vitro. The top-performing capsid, AAV-BI-hTFR1, exhibited more efficient gene delivery to human brain endothelial cells and improved active transport across a human vascular monolayer. When systemically administered to adult TFRC knock-in (KI) mice carrying a chimeric Tfrc gene with a humanized extracellular domain, BI-hTFR1 transduced the majority of neurons and astrocytes across multiple brain regions. The enhanced tropism was entirely dependent on an interaction with the humanized TfR1, as we observed no enhancement in wild type (WT) mice. The tropism was also selectively enhanced in the CNS, consistent with the high level of expression of TFRC on the CNS vasculature relative to the vasculature in other organs (12)."

We used each capsid to individually package a single-stranded genome that expresses nuclear mScarlet and Luciferase under the control of the ubiquitous CAG promoter (ssAAV-CAG-NLS-mScarlet-P2A-LuciferaseWPRE-SV40pA). The four capsids exhibited elevated association with and transduction of CHO cells that stably express human TFRC but not the control CHO cells or those that express TFRC from rhesus macaque, marmoset, or mouse (Fig. 1B and C, and fig.

Although the extent of AAV associated with primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMVECs) and a human brain endothelial cell line (hCMEC/D3) varied (Fig. 1D), each of the four TfR1-binding capsids exhibited significantly enhanced transduction of both brain endothelial cell types compared to AAV9 (Fig. 1E)."

    "text": "To evaluate whether binding to TfR1 is necessary for the increased transduction of brain endothelial cells by BI-hTFR1, we assessed hCMEC/D3 transduction in the presence of two anti-TfR1 antibodies: OKT9, a monoclonal antibody that binds the TfR1 apical domain (26) or AF2474, a polyclonal antibody that competes with Transferrin (Tf) for TfR1 binding. We found that transduction was significantly inhibited by increasing concentrations of OKT9 but not by AF2474 (Fig. 2A), suggesting that an interaction with the human TfR1 apical domain was required for the enhanced transduction mediated by BI-hTFR1 in these cells. Consistent with this result, OKT9 directly competed with BI-hTFR1 for binding to purified human TfR1 (fig. S2B). Notably, binding to the TfR1 apical domain is a common feature of several antibody-based BBB shuttles that have been tested in humans and likely positions the binding site away from the Tf binding site. This is important because surface TfR1 is thought to be mostly occupied by Tf based on the typical 10\u201320 µM blood concentration of iron-bound holo-Tf (27) and its sub nanomolar binding affinity for TfR1 (fig. S2C). Given the double digit nanomolar affinity of BI-hTFR1 for human TfR1, Tf would be predicted to outcompete BI-hTFR1 for binding to TfR1 if their binding epitopes overlap. Using BLI, we found that BI-hTFR1 binds human TfR1 with similar kinetics whether in the presence or absence of a receptor-saturating concentration of holo-Tf (Fig. 2B and fig. S2D) and that BI-hTFR1 is capable of binding a preformed complex of human TfR1 and Tf (Fig. 2C). Consistent with the BLI results, OKT9, but not Tf, inhibited the association of BI-hTFR1 with hCMEC/D3 cells and its colocalization with human TfR1 (Fig. 2D and fig. S3)."

At 4°C, ATP-dependent transcytosis is suppressed but passive transport, at least in part due to paracellular crossing, can occur, providing a measurement of leakiness that is a known issue with the use of hCMEC/D3 transwell assays (28). As previously reported, AAV9 crossed the transwell barrier more efficiently than AAV2 at 37°C, and the number of vector genomes detected in the bottom chamber was significantly reduced at 4°C for both AAVs as is consistent with ATP-dependent transcytosis (2931). Significantly more BI-hTFR1 was actively transported to the bottom chamber than AAV9 or AAV2 (Fig. 3B). Passive transport of BI-hTFR1 and AAV2 were reduced relative to AAV9, likely due to increased association with the cells."

We explored whether BI-hTFR1 transcytoses hCMEC/D3 cells via the RMT pathway of TfR1 by assessing its colocalization with various organelle markers. We found that BI-hTFR1 partially colocalized with markers of the early and late endosomal pathway (Rab5 and Rab7) as well as the trans-Golgi network (TGN46), but did not extensively colocalize with markers of the cis-Golgi (Rcas1) or endoplasmic reticulum (KDEL) (Fig. 3C and fig. S4). In contrast, AAV2 was not highly colocalized with any of the endosomal or organelle markers with the exception of TGN46. Partial colocalization of both AAVs with TGN46 is consistent with the requirement for trafficking of AAVs to the trans-Golgi for transduction (33). Cell surface TfR1 clustering promotes clathrin-coated pit formation (34) and uptake into a subpopulation of endosomes enriched in Rab5 (35). This is consistent with our observation that BI-hTFR1 colocalized with Rab5 to a greater degree than AAV2. A smaller proportion of TfR1 colocalizes with Rab7 (36), which decorates endosomes associated with transcytosis (37) and the lysosomal degradation pathway. This is again consistent with our observation of a partial overlap between BI-hTFR1 and Rab7 localization in the cells. Our colocalization assays suggest that BI-hTFR1 engages TfR1 and is actively transported across the human BBB model via RMT. In contrast, AAV2 is predominantly trafficked to the trans-Golgi (33)."

To test this, we used TFRC knock-in (KI) C57BL/6J mice in which exons 4\u201319 of the mouse Tfrc encoding the extracellular domain were replaced by the corresponding region of human TFRC (Fig. 4A) (38). Levels of the mouse-human hybrid gene mRNA and protein products were found to be similar to those in WT mice (fig. S5). Therefore, we deemed these mice suitable for assessing the tropism of AAVs targeted to human TfR1. We intravenously injected BI-hTFR1 or AAV9:CAG-NLS-mScarlet-P2A-Luciferase-WPRE-SV40pA at 5 x 1011 vg/mouse into adult female C57BL/6J or TFRC KI mice (Fig. 4B). Three weeks post-injection, we observed enhanced biodistribution to and transduction of the brain and spinal cord by BI-hTFR1 in the TFRC KI but not in control C57BL/6J mice (Fig. 4C and D, Fig. 5A and B, and fig. S6). Increased biodistribution and transduction relative to AAV9 were not observed in any of the other organs that were assessed, indicating that the interaction with human TfR1 selectively enhanced the CNS tropism. Comparing the TFRC KI mice that received BI-hTFR1 to the C57BL/6J mice that received AAV9, we detected 6-fold and 12-fold more viral genomes; 54-fold and 43-fold higher viral mRNA transcript levels; 132-fold and 58-fold greater Luciferase enzymatic activity in the brain and spinal cord, respectively.

In contrast, in C57BL/6J mice, BI-hTFR1 transduced less than 1% of NeuN+ cells in the cortex and striatum and thalamus. AAV9 transduced 1\u20136% of NeuN+ cells in these same regions regardless of the mouse strain. BI-hTFR1 transduced more than 80% of the SOX9+ astrocytes in the cortex, striatum, and thalamus of TFRC KI mice, in comparison with 10% or fewer SOX9+ cells in C57BL/6J mice, or 20% or fewer SOX9+ cells transduced by AAV9 in C57BL/6J mice (Fig. 5E and F). Consistent with our biodistribution and transduction data, mScarlet levels in the livers of C57BL/6J and TFRC KI mice were comparable between AAV9 and BI-hTFR1 (fig. S6A and B). We observed a significant reduction of biodistribution to the DRGs in TFRC KI animals treated with BI-hTFR1 relative to AAV9 controls (Fig. 4C); DRG cell transduction by AAV9 or BI-hTFR1 in C57BL/6J or TFRC KI mice is shown in fig.

Additionally, we administered BI-hTFR1:GBA1 to a separate group of TFRC KI mice at a 20-fold lower dose (5 x 1012 vg/kg). For the untreated control mice, we used C57BL/6J mice, which possess the same genetic background as the TFRC KI mice.

S7A and B). In the mice injected with the high dose of AAV9, we observed minimal GBA expression in the brain but similar amounts of viral genomes, GBA expression, and GCase activity in the liver compared to the mice injected with the high dose of BI-hTFR1 (Fig. 6B and 6D, and fig. S7C); as expected, in the mice injected with the low dose of BI-hTFR1, the amount of viral genomes in the liver was reduced relative to the high dose AAV9 group. Reductions in GCase activity in the brain and CSF have been reported to be associated with the progression of Parkinson's disease (40, 41), and previous studies suggest that GBA1 delivery to the brain can treat neuronal αsynucleinopathy (42\u201344). Notably, in the mice that received the low dose of BI-hTFR1, we observed neuronal transduction in regions linked to motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease such as the substantia nigra pars compacta, deep cerebellar nuclei, and other parts of the brainstem (Fig. 6C and fig. S7A) (45). Under the same imaging conditions, GBA-HA was not detected in the brains of the mice injected with the high dose of AAV9. This suggests that a 20-fold lower dose of BI-hTFR1 led to greater GBA levels in disease-relevant brain regions compared to AAV9."

Protein shuttles designed to bind human TfR1 to facilitate RMT are now in the clinic and are showing evidence of CNS entry (NCT04023994) and efficacy (46). The TfR1 apical domain is also a receptor target of natural viruses (47\u201351), indicating that this protein can be exploited for viral entry. Importantly, we demonstrated that BI-hTFR1 binds human TfR1 and pre-formed TfR1-Tf complexes with comparable kinetics and does not compete with holo-Tf for TfR1 binding. The ability to bind TfR1 in the presence of its natural ligand is critical because AAVs cannot be administered at doses capable of competing with Tf for TfR1 binding. The use of this validated transport mechanism bolsters our confidence that BI-hTFR1 can perform well as a CNS-targeting human gene therapy vehicle."

Because our approach did not require the introduction or conjugation of bulky protein domains as a means to retarget the AAV (52\u201358), we do not anticipate additional complexities in the manufacturing of BI-hTFR1 compared to AAV9, one of the top producing natural AAVs. Indeed, we consistently produced and purified BI-hTFR1 with final yields comparable to those of AAV9, and determined that BI-hTFR1 can be purified with affinity resins commonly used in AAV manufacturing (fig. S8) As compared to natural AAV capsids such as AAV9 and AAV2 that are used in approved gene therapies, BI-hTFR1 demonstrated the remarkable ability to be actively transported across a human brain endothelial cell layer and to cross the BBB and transduce cells throughout the brains and spinal cords of TFRC KI mice after intravenous delivery. BI-hTFR1 exhibited a broad CNS tropism enhancement similar to those observed with engineered mouse BBB-crossing capsids, e.g., AAV-PHP.B, BI28, AAVF, and 9P31 that bind to mouse GPIanchored proteins LY6A, LY6C1, or Car4 (25, 59, 60). By engaging highly abundant CNS endothelial cell surface proteins as new receptors, these capsids are able to efficiently cross the BBB and gain access to parenchymal cells."

This stands in contrast to capsids identified from conventional selections with unknown MOAs and therefore unknown potential to translate to other species including humans. We do not expect the human TfR1-targeting AAVs reported in this study to exhibit enhanced CNS tropisms in NHPs such as macaques and marmosets. Therefore, tests in these species would only be valuable in terms of profiling biodistribution, immune responses, and toxicity in the absence of the target, human TfR1. Knowing the precise target of the AAV capsid also aids the prediction of its function in human patients. For instance, there are no known missense variants with an allele frequency greater than 1 in a 1000 within the TFRC apical domain (61). Therefore, we predict that BI-hTFR1 binding to human TfR1 will not be impacted by common variations within the coding sequence of the human apical domain."

For instance, disease models are typically created using mice and, in the absence of a capsid with an enhanced CNS tropism that translates across species, studies will need to use a surrogate mouse BBB-crossing capsid to deliver and test their potentially therapeutic payloads in these disease models. With BI-hTFR1, the gene therapy product that would be delivered to human patients can be tested, without switching out the capsid for a surrogate, in a mouse disease model that has been crossed with TFRC KI mice. Using a therapeutically relevant payload, we found that BI-hTFR1 could deliver 30 times the number of AAV:GBA1 genomes to the brains of TFRC KI mice and increase brain and CSF GCase activity as compared to AAV9. Even at a 20-fold lower dose, GBA1 expression was detectable throughout the brain in BI-hTFR1:GBA1 treated mice. However, the TFRC KI mice were WT with respect to Gba1 and only the high dose of BI-hTFR1:GBA1 led to increased brain and CSF GCase activity that were detectable above the endogenous mouse GCase activity."

Therefore, we used the global 2:1 exponential association and decay model. However, we are not implying that the binding between the TfR1-targeting capsids and TfR1 is bivalent. The kinetic constants shown in fig. S2 should be interpreted with caution due to the following factors: First and foremost, the high density of binding epitopes on the AAV surface may lead to local increases in the effective concentration of the receptor analyte, which results in a higher apparent affinity (62). Second, TfR1 itself is bivalent, which could contribute to the aforementioned avidity artifact and also result in the bridging of closely loaded adjacent AAVs. While probes were loaded to less than 60% of their total binding capacity, the uniformity of loading cannot be controlled and a fraction of the measurements may result from 2:1 binding of the receptor dimers to adjacent capsids (63). Third, transitional binding states due to conformational changes or sequential binding events may contribute to our observation of multi-phasic binding kinetics."

BI-hTFR1, AAV2, and AAV9 with capsid-specific barcoded transgenes were pooled and added to the top well of the transwell at 25,000 vg/cell (each AAV). After three hours of incubation at 37°C or 4°C, 22 µL of media was extracted from the bottom chamber. To detect the amount of AAV in the media, extracts were treated with DNaseI (NEB, M0303S) for 15 minutes at room temperature, then diluted in TE buffer (5 mM EDTA), and denatured at 70°C for 10 minutes to deactivate DNaseI. The extracts were then diluted in 5% Tween 20 with UltraPure™ Salmon Sperm DNA Solution (ThermoFisher, 15632011). The amount of AAV that passed through the transwell was measured by qPCR using a standard curve of known AAV quantities derived from AAV-containing media applied to the top well."

For cell counting, image settings were exposed to detect low mScarlet expressing cells in each sample group within each brain region. The Z-stack was reconstructed into a full-single-stack image using Keyence Analysis Software and exported as separate TIFs for each channel imaged. Images were then imported as input data into ilastik version 1.4.0 (66) where the Pixel Classification within the segmentation workflow was used. All color/intensity, edge, and texture features were selected and used during training. Training was performed to distinguish foreground and background pixels across images that represented the cortex, striatum, or thalamus in C57BL/6J or TFRC KI mice that had received BI-hTFR1 or AAV9 in NeuN or SOX9 stained brain sections. Predictions were then exported as probabilities in TIF format and then imported into CellProfiler 4.2.4 (67). A custom workflow was created to determine percent overlap between positively transduced cells and antibody markers. First, channels were aligned using the Align module. Second, the IdentifyPrimaryObjects module with Otsu two classes thresholding method was used to detect and segment foreground objects (positively transduced cells, NeuN-positive, or SOX9-positive cells) from background in the images. Third, foreground objects were then expanded by 2\u20135 pixels using the ExpandOrShrinkObjects module. Fourth, the MaskObjects module was used to determine the number of colocalized objects that overlap with a threshold of 40% overlap or more. A separate CellProfiler workflow was created where the IdentifyPrimaryObjects module was used to detect foreground and background objects (two class) and then the OverlayOutlines module was used to overlay an outline of detected foreground objects onto the raw input image of the mScarlet, NeuN, or SOX9 channel. The images were exported with the SaveImages module. The exported image was then used to verify if further training with the Pixel Classification in ilastik was needed in order to detect missed or improperly classified cells. An independent evaluator without prior knowledge of expected outcomes conducted a manual count of randomly selected images using the Photoshop Count Tool to determine the percent overlap of mScarlet-positive cells with NeuN or SOX9-positive cells in stained tissue. The results were evaluated to be within ± 5% deviation."

Briefly, 20 µL of serum or the volume of tissue lysate containing 30 µg of protein was added into each well. Assay buffer was added to a total volume of 50 µL. Then, 50 µL of 1X enzyme substrate was added to each well. Samples were gently mixed and incubated for one hour at room temperature. The fluorescence signal at an excitation/emission of 570/610 nm was measured in end-point mode using the EnVision 2104 plate reader (PerkinElmer). A resorufin reference fluorescence standard curve was used to determine the amount of reaction product in each well from the measured relative fluorescence units (RFU). The resulting values were used to calculate enzyme activity, expressed in µU per mL of blood or µU per mg of protein. One unit of GCase activity is the amount of enzyme that generates 1 µmol of product per minute under the specified reaction conditions."
