Three clinical forms of GD have been defined based on the absence (type 1, GD1) or presence (types 2 and 3) of neurological signs. Early diagnosis can reduce the likelihood of severe, often irreversible complications. The aim of this study was to validate the ability of factors from the Gaucher Earlier Diagnosis Consensus (GED\u2011C) scoring system to discriminate between patients with GD1 and controls using real\u2011world data from electronic patient medical records from Maccabi Healthcare Ser\u2011 vices, Israel's second\u2011largest state\u2011mandated healthcare provider."

However, delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis is frequent, owing to the complex and non-specific clinical presentation, together with a lack of awareness about this rare disease [1, 9\u201311]. Approximately one in six patients report remaining undiagnosed for 7 years or more after first consulting a doctor with symptoms [9]. Physicians and patients both report multiple referrals to a range of different specialties prior to GD diagnosis, with primary care, hematology/hematology-oncology, and pediatrics being the main specialties to which patients first present symptoms [9]."

Preliminary validation of the GED-C was able to discriminate between patients with GD and those with overlapping manifestations from other disorders, in studies from the United Kingdom [13] and Finland [14].

This is in line with a study of electronic records for splenomegaly in the Danish National Registry of Patients; the total number of patients coded for splenomegaly was lower than expected, leading the authors to conclude that splenomegaly as a clinical finding was probably under-coded in the ICD system [17]. Similarly, machine learning algorithms using ICD-9 codes did not perform well in identifying patients with systemic sclerosis; the highest-performing algorithms in this study incorporated clinical data with ICD, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), codes [18]. Unfortunately, ICD-10 codes were not available in the MHS database. Under-coding could be related to the difficulty in translating signs and symptoms into a clear and unambiguous classification code, coupled with time pressures on physicians [19]."

In addition, because GD is a rare disease, the number of individuals with GD, even within this relatively large database of individuals, is restricted and there are inherent limitations to the development of an algorithm using such a small data set of patients. In our research, we employed a manual examination of unstructured text notes to identify features related to GD. The reason for resorting to manual screening was that the existing Hebrew resources for training natural language processing (NLP) are inadequate to accomplish this task using computer-based methods [21]. Manual screening was feasible when limited to 265 patients and 265 controls but not for the entire control cohort. Similarly, machine learning diagnostic algorithms will not be able to be based on manual screening of free-text notes. In addition, our study analyzed data from patients retrospectively, a prospective design would have been preferable in terms of standardization of data collection and reducing potential sources of bias."
