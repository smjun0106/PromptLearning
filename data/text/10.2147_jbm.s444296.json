    "text": "Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease (LSD), caused by over 300 mutations in the GBA1 gene located on the long arm of chromosome 1, region 2 band 1.1,2 This causes a deficiency of a key lysosomal enzyme called β-glucosidase (also known as glucocerebrosidase) in the leukocytes. This enzyme is critical in the metabolic conversion of glucosylceramides (sugar-containing fat) to glucose and ceramide. Because of its deficiency, glucosylceramides accumulate in the lysosomes (digestive machinery of macrophages), transforming the macrophages into Gaucher cells that characterize Gaucher disease.3 This material/substrate (glucosylcerebroside) is continuously produced by the body but the lysosomes cannot break it down, it gets \"stored\" in the macrophages, hence its name, LSD. Therefore, these transformed macrophages accumulate in the body's organs like bone marrow, spleen, liver, and nerves, impairing these organs' functions.4 GD has no sex predilection and is the second most common lipid storage disease after Fabry disease.5 It is a rare disease with a prevalence of 1 in 100,000 and an incidence of 1 to 60,000 births in the general population.3 The incidence drastically rises to about 1 in 450 births among Ashkenazi Jews.6 In Africa, data is limited, however, a number of cases have been reported by several authors, from South Africa, Morocco, Mali, and Kenya.2,6\u20138 In Uganda, data about the condition is lacking. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of Gaucher disease to be reported in the country."

These investigations are usually done to investigate other suspected conditions like hematological malignancies as was suspected in this case. In our case, a bone marrow aspirate was done for suspected leukemia. Giemsa stained smears revealed large cells with small eccentric nuclei with basophilic cytoplasmic inclusions which were suspected to be Gaucher cells. Examination of the H&E stained trephine biopsy showed abundant accumulation of macrophages crowding out all hematopoietic cells. The macrophages had eccentric condensed chromatin and abundant cytoplasm with wrinkled paper-like accumulations which were weakly PAS positive. Based on the presence of these cells and the clinical picture, a diagnosis of GD type 1 was reached at. However, although Gaucher cells are pathognomonic for the disease, pseudo-gaucher cells have been reported in several other conditions. Pseudo-gaucher cells are seen in chronic myeloid leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, myeloma among others.14 Following detection of Gaucher cells, the diagnosis is confirmed by laboratory demonstration of deficiency of glucocerebrosidase enzyme activity in the white blood cells (Beta-glucosidase leukocyte blood test). Patients with type 1 GD usually have some residual activity of the enzyme. Also, the test may not be helpful in carriers for which genetic testing is required to detect variants in the GBA1 gene.1,5 In the case presented, enzyme testing was not done and it is not available in the country. Attempts were made to have it done but the only available option was shipping the sample to India at a cost that the family could not afford."

Recombinant glucocerebrosidase enzymes (imiglucerase, velaglucerase alfa, and taliglucerase alfa) are currently in use; however, these are not available in most underdeveloped countries. In our setting, treatment is largely supportive as indicated in the case above and in several cases reported in Kenya.6 After 6 months of supportive care, cytopenia and organomegaly were worsening and therefore a total splenectomy was done despite the adverse consequences. Splenectomy is indicated as one of the treatment options in patients not receiving ERT but the prognosis after the procedure is still debatable. There may be an improvement in hematological abnormalities,15 however, the disease tends to worsen in other organs with an increased risk of pulmonary hypertension and malignancy16 as seen in the case above. After splenectomy, the hematological parameters showed an improvement with hemoglobin in the normal range. The white blood cells improved beyond the normal upper limit and this coincided with a fever although there were no other features of possible infection. Contrary to hemoglobin and white blood cells, platelets remained consistently low, lower than the pre-splenectomy values. Additionally, she started experiencing bone pains with evidence of Erlenmeyer flask deformity but without osteonecrosis. The pain could be a result of sudden increase in the Gaucher cells in the bones following splenectomy. Ultimately, we predict that she will suffer pathological fractures. Other recommended treatment options include substrate reduction using either eliglustat or miglustat. These block the production of glucocerebrosides thus preventing their accumulation in the macrophages.5"

Diagnosis and access to standard care for rare conditions like GD is still a challenge in developing countries like Uganda. Although ERT is the standard of care for GD, splenectomy is still an option especially in low resource settings where ERT is unavailable. Although splenectomy may result in an improvement of the hematological parameters, it should only be done if it is indispensable because of the deterioration that may follow."
