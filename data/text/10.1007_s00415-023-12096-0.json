Four adult cohorts, including one non-ambulatory ERT-experienced (n = 6) and three ambulatory cohorts, (two enzyme replacement therapy [ERT]-experienced cohorts [2\u20136 years (n = 11) and ≥ 7 years (n = 6)]), one ERT-naïve cohort (n = 6), received 20 mg/kg intravenous-infused cipa plus 260 mg oral mig biweekly. Change from baseline (CFBL) for multiple efficacy endpoints at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, safety, and immunogenicity data were assessed. Six-minute walking distance (% predicted) improved at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months: pooled ambulatory ERT-experienced cohorts, mean(± standard deviation [SD]) CFBL: 6.1(± 7.84), n = 16; 5.4(± 10.56), n = 13; 3.4(± 14.66), n = 12; 5.9(± 17.36), n = 9, respectively; ERT-naïve cohort: 10.7(± 3.93), n = 6; 11.0(± 5.06), n = 6; 9.0(± 7.98), n = 5; 11.7(± 7.69), n = 4, respectively. Percent predicted forced vital capacity was generally stable in ERT-experienced cohorts, mean(± SD) CFBL − 1.2(± 5.95), n = 16; 1.0(± 7.96), n = 13; − 0.3(± 6.68), n = 10; 1.0(± 6.42), n = 6, respectively, and improved in the ERT-naïve cohort: 3.2(± 8.42), n = 6; 4.7(± 5.09), n = 6; 6.2(± 3.35), n = 5; 8.3(± 4.50), n = 4, respectively. Over 48 months, CK and Hex4 biomarkers improved in ambulatory cohorts. Overall, cipa + mig was well tolerated with a safety profile like alglucosidase alfa. ATB200-02 results show the potential benefits of cipa + mig as a long-term treatment option for Pompe disease. Trial registration number: NCT02675465 January 26, 2016."

    "text": "Pompe disease is a rare, multisystemic, and progressive lysosomal disorder caused by inherited pathogenic variants in the acid α-glucosidase (GAA) gene [1, 2]. This results in partial-to-full deficiency of the GAA enzyme that is responsible for the breakdown of lysosomal glycogen [1]. The functional deficiency of GAA leads to the accumulation of lysosomal glycogen, dysregulated autophagy and cellular damage in many tissues, most prominently skeletal muscle, smooth muscle and, in infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD), cardiac muscle [1]. Pompe disease can be broadly classified into two subtypes: IOPD and late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) [3, 4]. The latter is generally less severe and slower progressing, with a broad phenotypic spectrum and residual GAA enzyme activity reported to be between ~ 1% and 30\u201340% [3\u20137]. Nonetheless, LOPD remains a debilitating disorder that eventually leads to wheelchair use and ventilator-assisted breathing and places a significant burden on patients, families, and healthcare systems [5, 6, 8]."

Alglucosidase alfa, a recombinant human GAA (rhGAA), was the first approved Pompe disease\u2013specific ERT [3, 13\u201317]. However, treatment with alglucosidase alfa does not prevent disease progression [9]. A plateau is typically reached 2\u20133 years after treatment initiation, followed by progressive decline [9\u201312, 18, 19], highlighting a critical unmet need for new therapies with a more durable treatment response. The suboptimal outcomes observed with alglucosidase alfa led to research to better understand the possible mechanistic challenges of delivering a rhGAA to skeletal muscle [20, 21]. First, rhGAA, which is most active at lysosomal pH, is less stable at the near-neutral pH of the bloodstream, resulting in rapid inactivation after infusion [20]. Second, less than 1% of rhGAA reaches skeletal muscle, meaning that efficient uptake requires that the rhGAA contains bis-phosphorylated mannose6-phosphate (bis-M6P) N-glycans for high-affinity uptake through the cation-independent M6P receptor (CI-MPR) [20]. Lastly, an rhGAA requires processing (proteolytic and N-glycan trimming) to enhance enzyme activity and affinity for the glycogen substrate [21]. The need to improve cellular enzyme uptake and glycogen clearance in target tissue to enhance clinical outcomes has led to the development of next-generation ERTs for Pompe disease [20, 22\u201327]."

Cipaglucosidase alfa is enriched with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell (naturally)-derived bis-M6P N-glycans to mediate high-affinity binding and effective uptake into muscle via CI-MPR. [30, 31]. Inside the cell, enzyme activity is maximized due to enhanced CHO cell-derived glycosylation; this ensures both proteolytic and N-glycan processing into a mature form of the enzyme that has maximal catalytic activity [21, 28]. In addition, the amount of rhGAA available for uptake and processing is maximized by adding the enzyme stabilizer, miglustat [28, 29, 31]. This stabilizes cipaglucosidase alfa in the circulation so that catalytic activity is maintained upon uptake into muscles\u2014where miglustat detaches from cipaglucosidase alfa in muscle cell lysosomes\u2014as well as increasing biodistribution of the enzyme [28, 31]."

The infusion was performed at a hospital or infusion center by qualified study personnel; for some eligible patients, the infusion could be performed at home by a trained home-infusion nurse. Changes in the duration of cipaglucosidase alfa infusion due to safety or tolerability issues were documented.

Long-term studies with alglucosidase alfa have shown that, despite initial improvement or stabilization, patients eventually experience a plateau or decline in muscle strength and motor and respiratory function [9, 10]. Additionally, the instability of alglucosidase alfa in the bloodstream and low bis-M6P N-glycan phosphorylation of alglucosidase alfa results in poor biodistribution and inefficient uptake by muscle cells [20]. Only a small amount of infused enzyme reaches the intended muscle tissue due to liver filtration, so efficient uptake of the remaining molecules is essential for maximal activity [20]. Novel treatments are needed to provide more efficient rhGAA delivery to muscle cells and offer patients durable and sustained improvements over the longer term [9\u201312]."

    "text": "Cipa + mig is a novel two-component therapy designed to overcome the challenges associated with alglucosidase alfa treatment [28, 29]. Cipaglucosidase alfa is enriched with bis-M6P N-glycans, which mediates more efficient delivery to skeletal muscle cells by improved CI-MPR uptake [20, 28, 31]. The CHO-derived cipaglucosidase alfa retains its ability to be fully processed into a mature form of the GAA enzyme within the target cell, thus maximizing catalytic activity [28, 31]. Combining cipaglucosidase alfa with the enzyme stabilizer miglustat enhances its stabilization in the bloodstream, improves biodistribution, and maintains the catalytic activity of cipaglucosidase alfa before muscle cell uptake [28, 29, 31]. Animal models support the proposed mode of action for cipa + mig. Cipa + mig improved multiple defects along the Pompe disease pathogenic cascade in GAA knock-out mice, including reduced lysosomal enlargement and autophagic build-up, resulting in improved muscle quality, architecture, and strength compared with alglucosidase alfa-treated or untreated mice [31, 34]. The potential for long-term benefits of cipa + mig was also suggested by early results of the Phase I/II ATB200-02 study [35] and the 12-month Phase III PROPEL study, in which clinically meaningful improvements were seen in crucial motor and respiratory functions for cipa + mig compared with alglucosidase alfa in patients with LOPD [32]."

Correlations between improvements in these biomarkers and improvements in clinical outcomes have been demonstrated in a population of pediatric LOPD and IOPD patients [39].

Worsening mobility necessitates wheelchair use, associated with a significant reduction in quality of life, greater disability, and greater burden on caregivers [9, 10, 40]. Respiratory failure and the need for ventilator support represents a second significant and negative milestone for patients with Pompe disease and is associated with an exceptionally high disease burden and a reduced quality of life [9, 10, 40]. While minimal clinically important differences for absolute 6MWD in meters and % predicted sitting FVC have not yet been established for LOPD, previous studies of other chronic diseases have identified an absolute CFBL in 6MWD change of 24\u201354 m (equivalent to a relative CFBL of 5\u201311%) and an absolute CFBL in % predicted sitting FVC change of 2\u20136% (equivalent to a relative CFBL of 3\u20139%) as clinically meaningful [40]. Our 48-month data, with a mean absolute CFBL of 30.4 m in ambulatory patients, along with improvements in muscle function, suggest that patients may be able to maintain their mobility over the long term with cipa + mig treatment.
