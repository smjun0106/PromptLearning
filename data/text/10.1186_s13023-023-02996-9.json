    "text": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare, autosomal recessively inherited, lysosomal storage disorder with a worldwide prevalence of 0.7 to 1.75 per 100,000 [1]. In Japan, the prevalence is estimated to be 1 in 330,000 [2], and a total of 211 patients are estimated to have GD [3]. Typical symptoms of GD include fatigue, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatosplenomegaly [4]. GD is categorized into three clinical phenotypes based on the presence or absence of neurological symptoms: type 1 GD (GD1; Mendelian Inheritance in Man [MIM] code #230800) is non-neuronopathic GD, whereas types 2 (GD2; MIM code #230900) and 3 (GD3; MIM code #231000) have neurological symptoms, including abnormal eye movements, seizure, and developmental delay, and are collectively known as neuronopathic GD (nGD) [4]. GD1 accounts for approximately 94% of cases in non-Japanese populations [5]. In contrast, the proportion of patients with nGD in Japan is higher compared with other countries, and GD2 and GD3 account for approximately 60% of GD cases [3, 6, 7]. GD2, the most severe and rapidly progressive form, has a stereotypical presentation and death in infancy [8]. However, the phenotypic heterogeneity of GD2 has been increasingly recognized in recent decades, and multiple therapeutic approaches have prolonged survival in these patients [8, 9]. GD3 is a chronically progressive form of nGD with symptoms occurring before 20 years of age; the clinical course is variable and more heterogeneous than GD2, with affected individuals requiring assistance to fulfill activities of daily life [4]. In Japan, patients with nGD receive the standard treatment, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), similar to patients with GD1. In addition, patients with nGD receive supportive care such as tracheostomy, home ventilator use, and antiepileptic drugs, depending on their symptoms. These treatments allow patients with nGD to live at home for longer than was previously possible."

Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) have been developed as a method to obtain and quantify patients' views of their functional ability, symptoms, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) [10]. As well as being a tool for use in clinical trials, PROMs can be used in clinical practice to improve communications between patients and clinicians about their disease progression and treatment outcomes [11]. Previous studies have assessed HRQOL in patients with GD [12, 13]; however, these studies did not use GD-specific measures of HRQOL and included only patients with GD1. General HRQOL measures do not provide sufficient information, and may not be sensitive enough to detect changes resulting from treatment, because many of the characteristics of GD, such as bone and neurological symptoms, are wide-ranging and have substantial effects on long-term quality of life. Although a GD-specific PROM questionnaire was recently developed for GD1 [14, 15], there is no PROM questionnaire that contains items on neurological symptoms or is specific for nGD. Therefore, a disease-specific measure of HRQOL for patients with GD, including nGD, is needed to assess the effectiveness of treatment and support."

The analysis included creating a coding list using text-mining software, followed by hierarchical cluster analysis and cooccurrence network analysis to identify keywords, major themes, and specific topics related to disease burden [16]. The results of these analyses were used to create a new set of PROM items specific for neurological symptoms that could be used in conjunction with a Japanese language\u2013validated version of the existing GD PROM [14]. Here we report the subsequent development and evaluation of the combined PROM questionnaire, consisting of pre-testing followed by validation of the PROM in the main survey of Japanese patients."

The questions were tailored to Japanese culture and revised as needed in response to patient and caregiver feedback after the pre-test. Analysis of PROM answers from a total of 49 Japanese patients with GD (or their proxies) indicated that the PROM has high internal consistency and test\u2013retest reliability and can be adapted for use in all types of GD.

Additionally, inter-item correlation analysis suggested that most items in Part 2 were positively correlated with items in the newly developed Part 3, which possibly reflects some repetition between these two parts [18]. However, Part 3 had a high level of test\u2013retest reproducibility, indicated by kappa coefficients > 0.60 for 13/16 items.

The higher burden experienced by patients with GD2 may partly relate to their age, as these patients were mainly children whose PROM items were answered by a caregiver as a proxy, whereas all patients with GD1 were adults who completed the PROM themselves. Although obtaining answers directly from patients rather than caregivers would be ideal, this is not always possible in real-life circumstances, such as when patients are very young children or have severe neurological symptoms. Nevertheless, it is not unusual for questions to be answered by proxy for very young patients, such as in a previous study of HRQOL in children with GD1 [13]. In our study, patients with GD3 were intermediate in age, with both children and adults included, and reported an intermediate level of burden. In support of this, we found that older age and longer duration of GD were correlated with a lower level of burden indicated by most PROM items, particularly in Parts 2 and 3, in patients with GD2. These results are consistent with the natural history of neuronopathic GD2, which usually develops in late infancy and progresses rapidly [1, 19]. We speculate that burden may be especially high soon after diagnosis but may decrease with time as treatment stabilizes the patient's condition and caregivers become more proficient at care."

Despite being a debilitating symptom, fatigue has not been investigated thoroughly in patients with GD, and there is no GD-specific instrument for measuring fatigue [21]. Although case reports suggest that ERT improves chronic fatigue [2224], exploratory modeling has not supported an association between fatigue and duration of ERT [25]. In the current study, the highest scoring item in Part 3 was P3-13, which refers to feeling tired after hospital visits or treatment. Scores for this item were consistently high across all GD types, indicating that chronic fatigue is an important unmet need for improving HRQOL.

The high proportion of incomplete answers to Part 1 for patients with GD2 (all of whom required a proxy) indicates that this section is unlikely to be applicable to these patients. Conversely, as the new Part 3 focuses on neurological symptoms, it is not applicable to patients with GD1. Additionally, before the PROM can be used in practice, a minimal important change in score (or subscores for each part) should be established in the future, which will allow the effects of therapy, as well as changes arising from the natural course of GD, on HRQOL to be evaluated [26, 27]."

Moreover, recruitment of~ 50 patients represents a relatively large proportion of the estimated ~ 200 patients with GD in Japan [3]. For some items, a limited amount of data could be collected, which may reflect the difficulties some patients experienced in answering these items. However, because of their young age and/or neurological symptoms, all patients with GD2 and one-third of patients with GD3 required a caregiver to complete the PROM on their behalf, which may not accurately reflect the patients' perception of burden. Despite this, proxy reports are recognized as useful and necessary in cases where the patient is too young or too cognitively impaired to complete a PROM themselves [28]. Furthermore, it is important to compare the disease burden of GD with the burden of other lysosomal diseases that present with similar neurological symptoms, such as Niemann-Pick disease type C and mucopolysaccharidosis. Therefore, research is needed to examine whether this scale, developed as a GD-specific PROM, is comparable to scales developed for other diseases or if it could be modified for use in other diseases. Finally, additional refinement of the PROM may be needed to minimize repetition, and translated versions of Part 3 need to be validated in populations outside Japan. Although this study demonstrated that Part 3 of the Japanese PROM has good reliability, future studies are needed, including construct validation based on hypothesis verification methods, determination of minimal important changes in scores, and cognitive debriefing for the English-language version. Our study has demonstrated the linguistic validity of the Japanese translations of Parts 1 and 2, as well as validated the newly created Japanese Part 3. Once Part 3 has been linguistically and cross-culturally validated in English (or other languages), the PROM can be used for multinational comparison of HRQOL and burden in patients with GD."

    "text": "This was a cross-sectional observational study conducted in Japan that comprised three stages. Stage 1 consisted of qualitative interviews with patients with nGD to determine which domains in available GD PROMs were relevant to the development of a Japan-specific PROM; Stage 1 results have been published [16]. Stage 2, conducted May 10\u201320, 2021, consisted of pre-testing of the PROM (created based on Stage 1) in patients with GD (or their caregivers), followed by 1:1 interviews to collect feedback on the applicability and difficulties in completing the PROM. Stage 3, conducted from October 17 to December 31, 2021, consisted of the main PROM survey of patients (or their caregivers). In Stage 3, participants completed the same survey twice, 2 weeks apart. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, the Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Practices, and all applicable laws and regulations. The informed consent form and study protocol were approved by Osaka University Clinical Research Review Committee (No. 20342). Written informed consent was required from all participants or their legal representative before starting the study. Data collected during the study were de-identified and anonymized."

Eligible patients had a confirmed diagnosis of GD (types 1, 2, or 3) by a physician and had been treated for GD; undiagnosed patients were not included. For patients < 16 years old, a caregiver (≥ 20 years old) participated on behalf of the patient and answered items if patients had difficulty answering themselves, such as for patients who had severe neurological symptoms. Participants were excluded if they were not fluent in Japanese. Participants were included in the study only once (i.e. in the pre-test or in the main test, not both). Each participant who completed the questionnaire received a gift card for 2000 Japanese yen."

    "text": "The questionnaire consisted of three parts (Additional file 1: Table S1; Additional file 2: Table S2). Parts 1 and 2 were translated into Japanese from the previously published PROM [14], with linguistic validation involving two specialist GD physicians. Part 1 consisted of 15 items, each answered on a 1\u20135-point scale; the score was decreased by 1 to create a 0\u20134-point scale and then multiplied by 2.5, resulting in a 0\u201310-point scale with a maximum (highest burden) total of 150 points. Part 2 consisted of nine items, each on a scale of 0\u201310 points, with a maximum total of 90 points. Part 3 initially consisted of 15 newly developed items, each on a 0\u201310-point scale, for a maximum total score of 150 points. However, in response to feedback from patients in the pre-test stage, one item (\"Over the past week, have you had any difficulty swallowing food or speaking?\") was divided into two items for the main survey (\"Over the past week, have you had any difficulty swallowing food?\" and \"Over the past week, have you had any difficulty speaking?\"). Therefore, there were 16 items in the main survey questionnaire, with a maximum total score of 160 points. All items in this report refer to the final PROM numbering."

A two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI), assuming 60% of patients with GD (all types) in Japan have had at least one symptom in the past 6 months, would equate to 13.86% precision, and a sample size of 40\u201350 patients with GD was calculated as sufficient."
