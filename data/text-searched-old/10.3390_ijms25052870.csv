Do not include your assumption.",Gaucher disease (GD) treatment includes enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT) and substrate-reduction therapy (SRT). These therapies significantly improve most clinical parameters. They do not improve neurological impairment. Lyso-Gb1 levels significantly reduce in treated patients compared to untreated ones. This indicates a response to therapeutic interventions. The combination of ERT and ambroxol reduces lyso-Gb1 concentration in CSF by 26%. This suggests a therapeutic approach for neuronopathic GD.
