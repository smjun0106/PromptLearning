Do not include your assumption.","The study investigates the role of autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases. It focuses on Tau accumulation in lysosomal storage disorders (LSD), particularly Gaucher's disease. The inhibition of glucocerebrosidase (GCase), a lysosomal enzyme, is linked to increased Tau accumulation. This enzyme is mutated in Gaucher's disease. The study suggests that alleviating ALP dysfunction could be a therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases.

The research employs human primary fibroblasts and AD brain-derived Tau seeds. It demonstrates that Tau accumulates in acidic degradative organelles, causing lysosomal stress. This accumulation is exacerbated by the inhibition of GCase activity. The study uses pharmacological tools like conduritol-Î²-epoxide (CBE) to inhibit GCase. This inhibition leads to increased Tau accumulation and lysosomal stress.

The findings indicate that interventions targeting GCase activity might mitigate Tau accumulation and lysosomal dysfunction. This could be beneficial for treating Gaucher's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders. The study advocates for further research into therapeutic strategies that enhance GCase activity or correct its dysfunction."
