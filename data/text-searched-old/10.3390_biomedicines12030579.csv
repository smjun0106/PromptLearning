#### Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT)
- ERT involves the intravenous administration of glucocerebrosidase.
- Imiglucerase (Cerezyme®) and Velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV®) are used.
- ERT is applicable to all patients with Type 1 Gaucher Disease (GD1).
- It is not suitable for ultra-rapid metabolizers of cytochrome CYP2D6.

#### Substrate Reduction Therapy (SRT)
- SRT inhibits glucosylceramide synthetase.
- Eliglustat and miglustat are available treatments.
- Eliglustat is a first-line treatment.
- Miglustat is a second-line treatment for patients who cannot receive first-line treatments.

#### Treatment Modifications in Pregnancy
- SRT is discontinued three months before pregnancy.
- ERT, like Imiglucerase, is recommended during pregnancy.
- Treatment adjustments are based on pre-pregnancy weight and clinical evolution.

#### Supportive Care
- Iron supplementation and antifibrinolytic agents are used for menorrhagia.
- Oral contraceptives are considered for young patients with menorrhagia.
- Nutritional support and monitoring of organomegalies and bone manifestations are crucial during pregnancy.

#### Genetic Counseling
- Genetic counseling is recommended for all patients.
- It informs patients about the specific risks related to their mutation.
- Preimplantation genetic diagnosis is available to avoid transmitting the mutation.

#### Monitoring and Follow-up
- Regular monitoring of bone density and organ size is necessary.
- Hematologic manifestations like thrombocytopenia require careful management.
- Immunization against infections is crucial, especially in splenectomized patients.

#### Special Considerations
- Psychological support is important due to the chronic nature of GD.
- Reproductive planning and safe delivery practices must be tailored to individual needs.
- Continuous reevaluation of treatment efficacy and side effects is essential.

These therapeutic interventions and management strategies aim to improve the quality of life and survival of patients with Gaucher Disease."
