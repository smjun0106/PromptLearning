Do not include your assumption.","### Mitigation, Alleviation, Reduction, Minimization

- Early diagnosis can reduce the likelihood of severe complications in Gaucher disease (GD).
- The Gaucher Earlier Diagnosis Consensus (GED-C) scoring system aims to minimize diagnostic delays.

### Therapy, Treatment

- Timely initiation of GD-specific therapy improves patient outcomes.
- Enzyme replacement therapy and substrate reduction therapy are used.
- These therapies impact hematologic and visceral outcomes.
- They may prevent irreversible bone disease and severe growth retardation.
- They reduce the risk of bleeding.

### Intervention, Remediation

- The GED-C scoring system helps clinicians identify individuals for further testing.
- This intervention reduces diagnostic delays.

### Healing, Cure, Remedy

- No specific details on healing, cure, or remedy were provided in the input.

### Conclusion

- An enhanced diagnostic model from the GED-C scoring system could lead to earlier, reliable diagnoses.
- This aims to minimize severe complications associated with GD."
