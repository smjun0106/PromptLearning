#### Therapeutics Development
- The study by Baden et al. supports developing GCase-based therapeutics. This is for diseases with GCase dysfunction. Novel brain penetrant GCase therapeutics are expected. They will be combined with dopamine replacement or stem cell approaches. This may lead to urgently needed disease-modifying therapies.

#### Intervention in Mitochondrial Dysfunction
- Increasing GCase activity with S-181, a small molecule chaperone, restored lysosome-mitochondria contact sites to normal. This suggests a role for lysosome-mitochondria contact sites in PD pathology.

#### Role of GCase in Therapy
- GCase mutations that affect function in the lysosome lead to glycolipid accumulation. This disrupts normal lysosomal function and autophagy. It leads to a-syn accumulation. Additionally, a-syn buildup impairs GCase activity. This creates a self-perpetuating cycle of lysosomal dysfunction and a-syn accumulation. This may trap mitochondrial proteins in the cytosol, exacerbating both mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction. GCase is also imported into the mitochondria via HSC70. It promotes the integrity and function of mitochondrial CI. GCase mutations increase its interaction with LONP1. This degrades GCase in mitochondria and promotes a-syn aggregation. Thus, mGCase increases ROS in mitochondria, oxidizing dopamine. In turn, the accumulation of oxidized dopamine-adducts further impairs GCase activity. This creates a second cycle of GCase dysfunction.

#### Potential Remediation Strategies
- The mechanistic link between GBA1 variants and PD may lie in the interplay between GCase functions in the lysosome and mitochondria. This could be investigated using similar proteomics approaches to Baden and colleagues. They attempt to assess protein interactions in native conditions."
