#### Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) and Substrate Reduction Therapy (SRT)
- ERT and SRT are clinically approved for Gaucher Disease (GD).
- ERT replaces deficient enzymes. SRT reduces substrate production.
- Both therapies aim to improve quality of life and prevent irreversible damage.

#### Chaperone Therapy
- Targets misfolded proteins in GD.
- Small chemical chaperones facilitate protein folding and stabilization.
- Chaperone therapy increases enzyme stability and activity.

#### Ambroxol as an Emerging Treatment Option
- Ambroxol (ABX) identified as an enzyme enhancement therapy (EET) agent.
- ABX stabilizes misfolded GCase enzymes.
- Shows promise in various GD forms, particularly neuronopathic types.

#### Clinical Studies on Ambroxol
- ABX improves enzymatic activity and reduces substrate accumulation.
- Exhibits variability in response among patients with different genotypes.
- Used as an adjunct therapy or alternative when standard treatments are inadequate.

#### Safety and Efficacy
- ABX generally well-tolerated with minimal adverse effects.
- Effective as a mucolytic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant agent.
- Ongoing studies assess long-term safety and optimal dosing.

#### Conclusion
- ABX shows potential in GD treatment, especially for neuronopathic forms.
- Further research is needed to standardize dosing and evaluate long-term effects.
- Collaborative efforts are essential to expand clinical trials and improve treatment outcomes."
