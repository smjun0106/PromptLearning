#### Therapy
- Enzyme replacement therapy is crucial for treating Gaucher Disease (GD). It positively impacts anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and organomegaly.

#### Intervention
- Non-invasive cardiac imaging is vital in the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of cardiac manifestations of GD. Both cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and echocardiography are essential tools.

#### Treatment
- Anticoagulation regimen based on apixaban was initiated due to bi-atrial enlargement and tachyarrhythmia. Rate control was achieved with beta-blockers.

#### Remediation
- The study of myocardial infiltration was conducted using CMR. Late gadolinium enhancement indicated the presence of focal interstitial fibrosis.

#### Cure
- High doses of enzyme replacement therapy have shown to improve left ventricular systolic and diastolic function. It also normalizes T-wave abnormalities within months. A complete normalization of the echocardiogram was observed after 3 years.

#### Conclusion
- Further studies should focus on cardiac abnormalities to establish an imaging hallmark of GD. A shared dataset from the International Collaborative Gaucher Group Registry is recommended to clarify incidence and provide additional therapeutic goals."
