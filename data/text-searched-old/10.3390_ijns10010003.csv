#### Treatment Initiation and Therapeutic Interventions
- In patients with the neonatal form of Gaucher Disease (GD), treatment was initiated after an ethics discussion.
- Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) was started for two neonates with GD2 at 13 and 4 days of life, respectively.
- ERT does not cross the blood-brain barrier, which limits its effectiveness in preventing neurological symptoms in GD2 patients.

#### Clinical Manifestations and Disease Management
- Two neonates with GD2 presented at birth with symptoms including anemia, low platelet counts, petechiae, hepatosplenomegaly, and cholestatic hepatitis.
- Four patients with GD1 developed clinical signs at around 3 years of age, including hepatosplenomegaly and bilateral femur osteonecrosis.
- These patients began ERT with positive clinical and biochemical responses.

#### Diagnostic Tools and Screening Outcomes
- The use of LysoGb1 in dried blood spots (DBS) at birth helped to discriminate between GD phenotypes.
- Molecular analyses confirmed the diagnosis of GD in all referred newborns.
- The overall incidence of GD from neonatal screening was 1:15,539 births.

#### Follow-up and Long-term Observations
- Most patients (n = 14) received regular follow-up evaluations, with a mean age at last visit of 3.8 years.
- Six out of sixteen patients exhibited clinical manifestations requiring therapeutic intervention.

#### Conclusion
- Early diagnosis through neonatal screening and subsequent timely treatment initiation have shown to improve outcomes in Gaucher Disease.
- The differentiation of disease phenotype at birth via biomarkers like LysoGb1 is crucial for targeted therapeutic approaches.
- Continuous follow-up is essential to monitor disease progression and adjust treatment plans accordingly."
