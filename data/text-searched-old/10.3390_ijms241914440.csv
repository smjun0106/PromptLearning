Do not include your assumption.","The study evaluated the effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and substrate reduction therapy (SRT) in patients with Gaucher Disease (GD). It focused on changes in biomarkers such as Lyso-Gb1, chitotriosidase (CHITO), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). The study included 34 patients. They were monitored over 30 months.

Lyso-Gb1 levels decreased significantly in both ERT and SRT treatments. This decrease correlated with other biomarkers. CHITO activity also decreased over the treatment period. This was true for both ERT and SRT, although the decrease was more pronounced in SRT. TRAP activity showed different trends. It increased in the ERT group but decreased in the SRT group. This suggests different effects on bone resorption between the therapies.

Platelet counts increased significantly in both treatment groups. This indicates an improvement in one of the hematological symptoms of GD.

The study confirmed the utility of these biomarkers in monitoring disease progression and response to therapy. It highlighted the effectiveness of both ERT and SRT in managing GD. The results suggest that both therapies can be tailored to individual patient needs based on specific biomarker responses."
