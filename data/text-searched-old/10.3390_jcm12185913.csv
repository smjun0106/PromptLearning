1. **Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) and Substrate Reduction Therapy (SRT)**:
   - ERTs and SRTs are treatments for Gaucher Disease (GD).
   - ERTs replace the deficient enzyme and are administered intravenously every other week.
   - SRTs are oral drugs that reduce the level of the substrate of the deficient enzyme.

2. **Home Infusions**:
   - Home infusions of ERTs like taliglucerase alfa are appreciated for reducing hospital visits.
   - Home infusions have been safely administered in various countries.
   - Home infusions are associated with high compliance rates and improved quality of life.

### Therapy, Intervention, Remediation, Healing, Treatment, Cure, Remedy in Gaucher Disease

1. **Taliglucerase Alfa**:
   - Taliglucerase alfa is one of the ERTs approved for GD treatment.
   - It has been administered safely in both hospital and home settings.
   - The safety and efficacy of taliglucerase alfa have been established through clinical studies.

2. **Home Therapy Service**:
   - Pfizer offers a home therapy service for GD patients treated with taliglucerase alfa.
   - The service is provided by trained nurses and aims to improve patient convenience and compliance.

3. **Safety and Compliance**:
   - The safety profile of home infusions is consistent with that observed in clinical settings.
   - High compliance rates are reported, even during the COVID-19 pandemic.

4. **Global Cohort Study**:
   - A study assessed the duration, compliance, and safety of home infusions of taliglucerase alfa.
   - The study involved patients from Israel, the US, Brazil, and Australia.
   - Results demonstrate the feasibility, safety, and high compliance of home infusions.

### Summary

Treatments for GD include ERTs and SRTs, with taliglucerase alfa being a key ERT administered both in hospitals and through home infusions. Home therapy services enhance patient convenience and compliance, with a strong safety profile supported by global studies."
