Do not include your assumption.","The research on Gaucher disease (GD) in a Drosophila model reveals several therapeutic interventions. These include the use of antibiotics to remove gut bacteria, which reduces the immune response and improves health. Pharmacologically boosting autophagy also extends survival and lowers the gut immune response. These findings suggest potential therapeutic benefits for GBA1-associated disorders through altering the gut microbiome or stimulating autophagy.

Direct stimulation of autophagy with rapamycin reduces immune activation. It partially rescues the lifespan phenotype in Gba1b-deficient flies. Modulating the NF-kB/IMD pathway through genetic manipulation shows mixed results. Overexpression and knockout of Rel, a core transcription factor of the IMD pathway, are detrimental to flies lacking Gba1b.

Rearing Gba1b-/- flies under germ-free conditions reduces systemic immune response. It improves survival and locomotor ability. This indicates that the gut microbiota plays a crucial role in immune activation in GCase-deficient flies. The reversal of microbiome-dependent immune activation partially ameliorates lifespan and neuromuscular phenotypes.

These interventions highlight the importance of the gut microbiome and autophagy in managing immune responses in GD. They suggest avenues for therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways."
