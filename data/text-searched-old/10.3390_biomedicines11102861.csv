Do not include your assumption.","The study focuses on chronic neuronopathic Gaucher Disease type 3 (GD3) in Spain. It is a retrospective multicenter study. The study includes patients diagnosed and followed in Spain. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital Sant Joan de DÃ©u, Barcelona, Spain.

Patients received enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) at diagnosis and during the study. The dosing regimens of ERT varied. Miglustat was administered to some patients. It was suspended in four due to disease progression or intolerance. Ambroxol was administered to nine patients at the end of the study. Many patients switched from miglustat to high doses of ambroxol. The overlapping treatments made it difficult to assess efficacy.

ERT showed significant improvement in hematological alterations, hepatic dysfunction, and organomegaly after diagnosis. However, neurological manifestations, kyphoscoliosis, and valvular calcifications progressed despite ERT. The response to miglustat and ambroxol was unclear.

Symptomatic medications were used. These included antiepileptic drugs for cardiovascular disease. One patient required gastrostomy and tracheostomy during follow-up.

The study collected comprehensive data on GD3 patients in Spain. It summarized demographic data, genotype and phenotype profiles, therapeutic interventions, and disease progression. The study highlighted the clinical heterogeneity of GD3 and the challenges in disease recognition and management."
