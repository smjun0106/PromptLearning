#### Background
Gaucher Disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive disorder. It results from a defect in the enzyme acid glucocerebrosidase. This defect leads to the accumulation of glucocerebroside in macrophages. The disease manifests in organ and tissue deterioration.

#### Treatment Approaches
1. **Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT)**:
   - Administered intravenously every 15 days.
   - Drugs include imiglucerase and velaglucerase alfa.
   - Well-tolerated and considered safe.
   - Does not cover neurological involvement and skeletal complications in some patients.

2. **Substrate Reduction Therapy (SRT)**:
   - Administered orally.
   - Drugs include miglustat and eliglustat.
   - Eliglustat inhibits glucosylceramide synthase, reducing substrate accumulation.
   - Suitable for adult GD1 patients as first or second-line therapy.

#### Real-Life Study: Eliglustat
- **Objective**: Evaluate the response of adult GD1 patients to eliglustat in daily clinical practice.
- **Methods**: 30 patients across Spain participated. They were previously treated with other therapies. The study included safety and efficacy evaluations.
- **Results**:
  - No patients discontinued due to adverse events.
  - 37% reduction in analgesic use after two years.
  - Significant improvements in physical function and pain scores.
  - Reduction in biomarkers like CCL18/PARC, YKL-40, and lipocalin-2 after two years.

#### Conclusion
Eliglustat maintains stability and improves the quality of life with minimal side effects. It shows significant reductions in both classic and novel biomarkers after two years of therapy."
