**Enzyme Replacement Therapy:**
- Enzyme replacement therapy with imiglucerase was initiated for a patient diagnosed with Gaucher Disease (GD) Type 1. This therapy led to a definitive diagnosis.

**Treatment Effectiveness and Prognostic Evaluation:**
- β-D-chitotriosidase activity was measured. It is a marker used for treatment effectiveness and prognostic evaluation in GD.

**Biomarkers for Disease Monitoring:**
- Elevated levels of glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1) were detected. Lyso-Gb1 is a reliable biomarker for GD.

**Genetic Analysis and Diagnosis:**
- A partial deficit in β-glucosidase activity was confirmed through dried blood spot (DBS) testing. Subsequent leukocyte assessment and genetic analysis identified two mutations, confirming GD.

**Importance of Early Diagnosis and Treatment:**
- The case emphasizes the significance of detailed past and family medical history. This approach aids in identifying potential cases of rare diseases like GD. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial.

**Impact of Early Detection on Management and Prognosis:**
- Early detection of lysosomal storage diseases like GD significantly impacts patient management and prognosis. This approach is highlighted as essential in cases of unexplained massive splenomegaly.

These points encapsulate the therapeutic and diagnostic interventions related to GD as discussed in the case report."
